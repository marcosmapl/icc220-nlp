I have not used automated testing at all before, so am still getting to grips with it. \\\\nThe framework that I have decided to use is Protractor, and I\\\\\\'m just looking at starting to write some basic tests, however, I\\\\\\'m having a bit of trouble getting hold of some of the HTML elements from within the spec.js file where my tests will be written. I have the following describe block in spec.js:\\\\ndescribe(\\\\\\'My App\\\\\\', function() {\\\\n    var loginForm = element(by.id(\\\\\\'loginForm\\\\\\'));\\\\n    var loginBtn = element(by.className(\\\\\\'form-control\\\\\\'));\\\\n    var usernameInputField = element(by.id(\\\\\\'inputName\\\\\\'));\\\\n    var passwordInputField = element(by.id(\\\\\\'inputPass\\\\\\'));\\\\n\\\\n    it(\\\\\\'should hit the VM hosted site\\\\\\', function() {\\\\n        browser.get(\\\\\\'http://192.168.x.xyz:8080);\\\\n        expect(browser.getTitle()).toEqual(\\\\\\'My app\\\\\\');\\\\n    });\\\\n\\\\n    //Test to log in:\\\\n    it(\\\\\\'should enter the username into the username field on log in form\\\\\\', function() {\\\\n        usernameInputField.sendKeys(\\\\\\'username\\\\\\');\\\\n        passwordInputField.sendKeys(\\\\\\'password\\\\\\');\\\\n    });\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\nMy conf.js file currently looks like this:\\\\nexports.config = {\\\\n    framework: \\\\\\'jasmine\\\\\\',\\\\n    seleniumAddress: \\\\\\'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\\\\\\',\\\\n    specs: [\\\\\\'spec.js\\\\\\'],\\\\n    multiCapabilities: {\\\\n        browserName: \\\\\\'firefox\\\\\\'\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nWhen I run the command protractor conf.js from the command line, I get some output that says:\\\\n\\\\nFailed: No element found using locator: By(css selector, \"[id=\"inputName\"])\\\\n\\\\nI have \\\\\\'inspected\\\\\\' the input field for the username on the form in the browser, and it shows that the HTML element\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'name\\\\\\' attribute is \\\\\\'inputName\\\\\\'.\\\\nI don\\\\\\'t understand why the console is giving me the error that says it\\\\\\'s trying to find the element using a \\\\\\'CSS selector\\\\\\'- I\\\\\\'m expecting it to try and find the element by it\\\\\\'s HTML tag\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'name\\\\\\' attribute... Clearly I\\\\\\'m doing something wrong in how I\\\\\\'m writing the \\\\\\'test to log in\\\\\\', because if I comment that out, and run protractor conf.js again, I get 0 failures- so the other test is running successfully...\\\\nWhat am I doing wrong here? How can I get the form input fields and enter correct log in details into them to check that the \\\\\\'log in\\\\\\' feature works correctly?\\\\nAs an aside, although I will want to test the \\\\\\'log in\\\\\\' capability too, is there  a way to \\\\\\'skip\\\\\\' this during testing, so that I can run the tests on all of the features of the app, without Protractor having to log in to the app every time to run the tests?\\\\nEdit\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve done what was suggested by @KatePaulk in their answer, and my test now looks like this:\\\\nvar usernameInputField = element(by.name(\\\\\\'inputName\\\\\\'));\\\\nvar passwordInputField = element(by.name(\\\\\\'inputPass\\\\\\'));\\\\n...\\\\nfunction loginAsUser(username, password) {\\\\n    username = \"abc\";\\\\n    password = \"xyz\";\\\\n    usernameInputField.sendKeys(username);\\\\n    passwordInputField.sendKeys(password);\\\\n\\\\n    loginBtn.click();\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nit(\\\\\\'should log the user in to app\\\\\\', function() {\\\\n    loginAsUser(username, password);\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\nand while the script is running, although the username & password fields are correctly populated on the log in form, I get an error message when the script is trying to press the \\\\\\'Log In\\\\\\' button, to submit the form:\\\\n\\\\nW/element - more than one element found for locator By(css selector, .form-control) = the first result will be used\\\\n\\\\nIf I continue the script after this, the browser window is closed, and the script exits.\\\\nWhat am I doing wrong with how I am retrieving & clicking the \\\\\\'log in\\\\\\' button?\\\\nEdit\\\\nAs requested, the HTML for the form is:\\\\n<div class=\"page-signin\">\\\\n  <div class=\"signin-header\">\\\\n    <section class=\"logo text-center\">\\\\n      <h1>Login to {{main.brand}}</h1>\\\\n    </section>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n\\\\n  <div class=\"signin-body\">\\\\n    <div class=\"container\">\\\\n      <div class=\"form-container\" data-ng-controller=\"LoginCtrl\">\\\\n        <div ng-show=\"errors.general || errors.username || errors.password\"\\\\n             class=\"alert alert-danger\">\\\\n            {{errors.general || errors.username || errors.password}}\\\\n        </div>\\\\n        <form class=\"form-horizontal\"\\\\n              data-ng-submit=\"login()\"\\\\n              name=\"loginForm\">\\\\n          <fieldset>\\\\n            <div class=\"form-group\">\\\\n              <div class=\"input-group input-group-first\">\\\\n                <span class=\"input-group-addon\"\\\\n                      ng-class=\"{\\\\\\'login-error-icon\\\\\\': errors.username}\">\\\\n                  <span class=\"ti-user\"></span>\\\\n                </span>\\\\n                <input type=\"text\" um-autofocus\\\\n                   class=\"form-control input-lg\"\\\\n                   data-ng-model=\"user.username\"\\\\n                   placeholder=\"Username\"\\\\n                   autocapitalize=\"off\"\\\\n                   name=\"inputName\">\\\\n             </div>\\\\n           </div>\\\\n            <div class=\"form-group\">\\\\n              <div class=\"input-group\">\\\\n                <span class=\"input-group-addon\"\\\\n                      ng-class=\"{\\\\\\'login-error-icon\\\\\\': errors.password}\">\\\\n                  <span class=\"ti-lock\"></span>\\\\n                </span>\\\\n                <input type=\"password\"\\\\n                   class=\"form-control input-lg\"\\\\n                   data-ng-model=\"user.password\"\\\\n                   placeholder=\"Password\"\\\\n                   name=\"inputPass\">\\\\n              </div>\\\\n           </div>\\\\n            <div class=\"form-group\">\\\\n                <div class=\"input-group login-checkbox\">\\\\n                    <span class=\"input-group-addon\">\\\\n                        <label class=\"ui-checkbox\">\\\\n                            <input data-ng-model=\"persistent\" type=\"checkbox\"/>\\\\n                            <span></span>\\\\n                        </label>\\\\n                    </span>\\\\n                    <label class=\"form-control input-lg\">\\\\n                        <input data-ng-model=\"persistent\" type=\"checkbox\"/>\\\\n                        <span>Remember me</span>\\\\n                    </label>\\\\n                </div>\\\\n           </div>\\\\n           <div class=\"divider divider-sm\"></div>\\\\n           <div class=\"form-control\">\\\\n              <input type=\"submit\"\\\\n                 class=\"btn btn-brand text-center pull-right\"\\\\n                 value=\"Log in\"/>\\\\n          </div>\\\\n          </fieldset>\\\\n        </form>\\\\n\\\\n      </div>\\\\n    </div>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\nI am creating a simple webapp that allows my support colleagues to run Selenium Java Code from my custom created API.\\\\nWhen from Eclipse (the app deployed in Tomcat8) I run a script, i can see in my screen that the webbrowser (in this case the chrome webdriver) is opened and I can actually see what is happening in my screen.

of Java mocking frameworks but all of the ones I\\\\\\'ve seen are quite old.  Can anyone point me to something relatively recent?\\\\nThanks\\\\nWe\\\\\\'re using the Performance Plugin running JMeter tests in Jenkins.  I\\\\\\'m looking for some way to change the status and/or notify when tests run slower.  Is there another plugin I could use?  Any ideas how to proceed with modifying or writing my own Jenkins plugin if none provide the functionality I\\\\\\'m looking for?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m a new QA tester in a company in an Agile environment. During the sprint commit I was told that one of my tasks was going to be testing user stories. How exactly do you test something like that? If anyone can give me any insight into this it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. \\\\nI was recently promoted to QA lead on an agile team working with offshore testers and an onshore development team.\\\\nWhat kind of things should I expect?\\\\nAny helpful tips for how to be awesome at this?\\\\nI was selected due to my soft skills not necessarily because I\\\\\\'m an experienced QA. Needless to say I\\\\\\'m a little confused on what kind of things I should be doing to ensure I do a great job.\\\\nAny resources out there that will be helpful?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m currently one of a group of developers developing tests for a web-based line of products. These products are separate but related, and are periodically released (ie versioned). \\\\nWe are trying to make our tests all \"run from the head\" against all different versions, meaning that the current state of our master test code branch can run meaningfully against arbitrary versions of the production builds. At first, this seems a bit intimidating, particularly since our tests are generally UI (Selenium) based, and hence, quite dependent on particular versions. \\\\nAny tips for making this process easier? Or at least, more doable?  \\\\nI am trying to re-purpose a QTP Shared Object Repository to be used in a different context, by exporting it to XML and processing the XML with an XML parser. So far, so good. The XML schema is simple and most of the data I need is there: HTML input field IDs and names, type of field, and the page of the application and the URL associated with that page.\\\\nThe problem is, I also need to know what the full contents of the WebList (Combo Box) and WebRadioGroup values were at the time that the Shared Object Repository was created.\\\\nI realize that Combo Boxes in HTML forms have both a value displayed to the user, and a value submitted as part of the HTML form, and the two values are not necessarily equivalent. That is fine. What we need for testing is the value contained within the HTML form -- the value that\\\\\\'s sent with an HTTP Request in the Body. The value that\\\\\\'s displayed to the user in the GUI is not relevant to our needs.\\\\nAlso, when there are multiple radio buttons in a group, HTML will encode the value with a developer-defined value depending on which button is selected. For example, they could assign value \"A\" to radio button 1, value \"B\" to radio button 2, and value \"C\" to radio button 3, and then if you try to get the value of the radio button group in the HTML, it will return the value of the button that has been clicked by the user.\\\\nI need to get those possible values into the Shared Object Repository, so that we can later process the Shared Object Repository\\\\\\'s exported XML and re-use that data.\\\\nSo my questions, which are closely related, are:\\\\n\\\\nCan the Shared Object Repository native format contain this data at all? Is it supported?\\\\nCan the Shared Object Repository\\\\\\'s XML-exported format contain this data? Will the format hold it?\\\\nCan any built-in or custom QTP scripts generate a Shared Object Repository containing this data automatically while recording a path through the application?\\\\n\\\\nI have a VBA script which i want to run in the post processing section of the QC 11 Excel Reports generator (using the UI, not the API). This script uses the Dictionary object in the Microsoft.Scripting reference. When designing it in Excel, i add the reference via Tools->References. \\\\nHow can this be achieved in QC?\\\\nIN HP QC 10, I\\\\\\'m looking to find all tests that have not had their design steps altered in the last 6 months.   Having trouble finding the correct table and query to do this.....\\\\nThanks,\\\\nI am currently working on a project that requires automating tests on a content player,\\\\nI am using sikuli for it.\\\\nThe problem is that we have piled up a large amount of screenshots which is becoming difficult to manage day by day.Size of image folder is becoming larger day by day. we want to reuse the older images as much as possible, but finding similar images is what has become a headache.\\\\nIs there a tool which could find similar screenshots from a folder? is there any strategy we could use further to manage it ?\\\\nTo explain better, if test B depends on test A, then\\\\n\\\\nif test A fails, then test B should not be run and fail implicitly\\\\nif test A produces some output, then it should be available for test B\\\\n\\\\nI can see why this would be bad for Unit Tests, which should run in isolation, but I was thinking about System Tests where these are common unavoidable scenarios, and it would possibly be a better alternative to long tests which require many steps. I am thinking of something that works like a build file or Ant (where targets play the role of tests).\\\\nIs this a terrible idea? If yes, are there testing frameworks that support this test style? If not, what problems am I overlooking?\\\\nI am currently testing a piece of vehicle management software. To kill two birds with one stone I am also going to create a user guide, alongside a similar document to point out and describe bugs. \\\\nThe document would need to be in a PDF format and would be screenshot heavy.\\\\nIf anybody has done anything similar could you advise a piece of software fit for this job? I.E PDF creation, snipping tool?\\\\nI am trying to avoid word at all costs.\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve received a job offer recently with a significant portion of the pay based on yet to be determined \"objective\" performance metrics. We are supposed to sit down together after I\\\\\\'ve worked there awhile to develop and agree on the metrics that will be used. The only metric suggested by the employer so far is the number of bugs in released code. \\\\nIs this workable? Is it a fair metric or, as I fear, will it introduce dysfunction? Are there other metrics that could/should be used? Some of the issues that concern me are defining what a bug is, who finds the bug (does it only count when the customer finds it?), how do bugs found in old releases count, does a bug caused by a requirements gap count, what happens when other people whose pay is not effected by this metric, such as developers, help out with testing before a big release, what about the conflict between finding all the bugs and getting the product shipped, etc. \\\\nIn other words, are there reasonable performance metrics that could be used? \\\\nTo record scripts in JMeter we need to run the proxy on local port 8080, where as in browser I need to configure for internet connectivity proxy to connect to internet.\\\\nThe company I work for is providing me internet through a proxy server.\\\\n\\\\nAnyone who knows how to record script using Jmeter while there is already internet proxy set up in the browser to connect to internet?\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve been trying to hire a tester for a few months without success. I really want to find someone who is both a tester and a developer, not because I want them to do two roles, but because the kind of testing I want them to do is all about automation and therefore I think they need to be able to at least programme in a scripting language like python to a reasonable level. Agencies tell me that it\\\\\\'s not realistic to aim to find such a person, and I think their reasoning is something like: a good developer would rather be a developer than a tester (more money, more prestige).\\\\nSo, my question is: is it realistic to try to find a developer turned tester or a tester who has learned to develop testing code? If not, what\\\\\\'s a good alternative approach?\\\\nEdit: Great answers, guys. Thanks so much: this has been genuinely helpful. If anyone here is interested in a test automation development role based in London, let me know!\\\\nWe have a need to verify content on our site using Selenium IDE; specifically for this question Youtube video served up in an iframe:\\\\n{<iframe width=\"506\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"player\" id=\"player\" allowfullscreen=\"1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9l1WYPhs0cc?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fxxx.com\"></iframe>}\\\\n\\\\n(origin xed out...)\\\\nI have tried to use Selenium to click on the video - no result, and running through a list I knew a video was not available - it went right through it, so that doesn\\\\\\'t work for verification.  I settled down to a storeEval statement and attempted to do the getElementById javascript statement, but that really can\\\\\\'t find the element that is loaded by the iframe.\\\\nAnybody had to verify Youtube content?\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve read that if a requirement can\\\\\\'t be verified by black-box testing or inspection, then it\\\\\\'s not a requirement, but a design specification.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m building a software that makes processing with on images acquired by a camera, and the processing itself should be verified because it is essential for producing the right image presented to the end user. \\\\nHowever it is very difficult to test this in black-box, even in gray-box, so I wonder if it should be listed as a software requirement? If yes, then is it OK for my software verification to have it verified in white or gray-box testing?\\\\n\\\\nPS: I\\\\\\'m building medical device software, thus following IEC 62304 standard, that specifies that my software requirements shall be verified through system testing.\\\\nI am working at a small in-house dev department in a non-IT organisation. Me and another junior dev are creating a mid-sized CRUD web application in ASP MVC. There is no formal test process in our department. I am trying to gently introduce some best practices including unit testing, of which I only have theoretical knowledge myself. \\\\nWe started with creating a nice, clean database schema. During the requirements analysis and database modelling phases, I went through piles of real data from our domain and then entered them all per hand in the database. Then the other dev got the task of creating the Model part of the project, writing the entity and repository classes needed for Linq to SQL. \\\\nI outlined my vision for the unit tests of his classes: We already have a small but consistent set of data we can use as a test data. I suggested that he automatically recreate the database from scratch, filling the tables per SQL script, and then let the tests run against the dataset. He agreed and went to work. \\\\nNow, a few weeks later, he has for some reason decided that he doesn\\\\\\'t like working with the data as it is. He initializes the database by re-creating the schema, and then fills it using our Linq classes and their connections. He does not pay attention to keeping the data in a state which is sensible for the domain. Example: in my data, a mouse could have a mutation expressed in the mammary glands. In his data, a drosophila can have a mutation expressed in the mamary glands, because he just set random connections between records from the proper tables, without caring for business meaning. \\\\nI see two problems with this approach. \\\\n\\\\nI think that the tests supposed to verify the work of our Linq classes should not use the Linq classes for initialization of the data set. From my point of view, this is a bad case of circular reasoning. \\\\nI would like to keep one set of test data which is applicable for most types of test, maybe with a few necessary variations. While there is no reason why the data used for unit testing the database connection should be the same as the data used for tests involving the users, there is also no reason to make it different. And the users cannot work with data which tells them that a drosophila has mammary glands. So, I would like us to adapt our tests to work with the old data set. \\\\n\\\\nMy co-worker is unhappy, because my suggestions mean extra work load. He feels that they are completely unnecessary. \\\\nMy questions for you: First, is his approach wrong (so we should change it), or is it right (maybe one of many possible right approaches)? Second, is my own suggestion right or wrong? Third, if his approach is so wrong we should change it, what arguments can I use to convince him? (He is absolutely no convinced by my \"circular reasoning\" argument). \\\\nUpdate User246 answered \\\\n\\\\nOf course if you don\\\\\\'t implicitly trust your Linq classes, you should test them.\\\\n\\\\nUnder which circumstances would I trust my Linq classes? Do I need to test them, or not? \\\\nHe/she also said: \\\\n\\\\nOne way to test the Linq classes would be to write the data using Linq and then read the data using some other means\\\\n\\\\nThis is exactly what I was planning to do. My question was: Why? Why cannot I test the Linq classes with themselves? I thought that it is so obviously a bad idea that it doesn\\\\\\'t need an explanation. But now that my co-worker does not believe that it is a bad idea, I realised that I have no arguments against it. So, what are the arguments for this view?\\\\nI am trying to export my project as a runnable jar and run it without driver.exe files being present.

Sometimes it gets marked as \"Will Not Fix\". \\\\nWhen a bug is marked \"Will Not Fix\" then it is supposed to give credit to the tester and an acknowledgement that the bug was valid but it was decided not to fix it.\\\\nWhat is the thinking process that can be used to decide whether a bug should go to \"Will Not Fix\" vs \"As Designed\"?\\\\nI am first time trying out automated web UI testing.\\\\nI just tried writing selenium python code which logs in to the website, waits till it redirects to target page and then tries to fetch certain information from that target page. I am facing several issues. For example I am getting TimeoutException when using headless chrome and I am not able to access properties of selected element on the target page. Also, I believe I might have to revise this function some times in future as the target website might change the UI/UX. So, I was thinking if I should use some tool which will allow me to use browser and capture my action as I do it and generate the script for my action, so that whenever the UI/UX of the target site changes, I will just have to redo action, recapture it in that tool and use the script generated. I just want to avoid time I am wasting in thinking and coding how I can imitate the actions myself. I have several such actions targetting different sites. So to reduce overall developement time I want to know if any such tool is there.\\\\nMy test steps are-\\\\n\\\\na) go to google.com\\\\nb) in the search box start typing a keyword example \"IBM\"\\\\nc) google displays all the matching results\\\\nd) Get the count of  matching results in a List of strings.\\\\n\\\\nfor (a), (b) I have:-\\\\nSystem.setProperty(\"webdriver.chrome.driver\", \"C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Work\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\chromedriver.exe\");\\\\n        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\\\\n        driver.get(\"http://www.google.com\");\\\\n        WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.name(\"q\"));\\\\n        element.sendKeys(\"IBM\");\\\\n\\\\nThe Question is how I do (d)?\\\\n\\\\nEnvironment : IE11\\\\nWebdriver/Selenium version : 3.141.59\\\\nLanguage : java\\\\n\\\\nSelenium code:\\\\ndriver.findElementByXPath(\"//span[contains(text(),\\\\\\'Logout\\\\\\')]\").click();**\\\\n\\\\nHTML code :\\\\n<span class=\"v-menubar-menuitem-caption\">Logout </span>\\\\n\\\\nChrome version : 75.0.3770.100 \\\\n\\\\nC:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\ramkrishna.bhandare\\\\\\\\Documents\\\\\\\\StressTestExamination\\\\\\\\OES\\\\n  Project>Title SeleniumExam.\\\\n\\\\nC:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\ramkrishna.bhandare\\\\\\\\Documents\\\\\\\\StressTestExamination\\\\\\\\OES Project>java -j\\\\nar \".\\\\\\\\Ramkrishna-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\"\\\\nStarting ChromeDriver 75.0.3770.8 (681f24ea911fe754973dda2fdc6d2a2e159dd300-refs\\\\n/branch-heads/3770@{#40}) on port 22106\\\\nOnly local connections are allowed.\\\\nPlease protect ports used by ChromeDriver and related test frameworks to prevent\\\\n access by malicious code.\\\\nException is caught\\\\norg.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: unknown error: failed to write automatio\\\\nn extension zip\\\\nBuild info: version: \\\\\\'3.141.59\\\\\\', revision: \\\\\\'e82be7d358\\\\\\', time: \\\\\\'2018-11-14T08:17\\\\n:03\\\\\\'\\\\nSystem info: host: \\\\\\'CSS-D-060\\\\\\', ip: \\\\\\'10.10.10.218\\\\\\', os.name: \\\\\\'Windows 8.1\\\\\\', os.a\\\\nrch: \\\\\\'amd64\\\\\\', os.version: \\\\\\'6.3\\\\\\', java.version: \\\\\\'1.8.0_144\\\\\\'\\\\nDriver info: driver.version: ChromeDriver\\\\nremote stacktrace: Backtrace:\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00C47DF3+1474035]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BC07D1+919505]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00B5CB43+510787]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00AF089E+67742]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00AEDF37+57143]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00B10CE4+199908]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00B1069D+198301]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00B0EECB+192203]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00AF5FF6+90102]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00AF765A+95834]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00AF7554+95572]\\\\n        GetHandleVerifier [0x00DA231C+1249612]\\\\n        GetHandleVerifier [0x00CF1575+525221]\\\\n        GetHandleVerifier [0x00CF1310+524608]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00C55D28+1531176]\\\\n        GetHandleVerifier [0x00CF1D4A+527226]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BD75F6+1013238]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BD746F+1012847]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BE365B+1062491]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BE379F+1062815]\\\\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BE2745+1058629]\\\\n        BaseThreadInitThunk [0x74F97C04+36]\\\\n        RtlInitializeExceptionChain [0x774BAD8F+143]\\\\n        RtlInitializeExceptionChain [0x774BAD5A+90]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nC:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\ramkrishna.bhandare\\\\\\\\Documents\\\\\\\\StressTestExamination\\\\\\\\OES Project>pause\\\\nPress any key to continue . . .\\\\n\\\\nBelow is my HTML code.

I have had to rewrite large portions of my code multiple times now, and I feel that there is a better approach to what I\\\\\\'m doing. I explain my design below.\\\\nDescription:\\\\nI am using Selenium/Java to do some data integrity testing. The website being tested is used to create and manipulate batches. These batches have various properties such as name, ID number, different quantities, and ingredients. This data for each batch is supposed to change and be updated as you progress through the workflow of the website. The Selenium tests are supposed to simulate the workflow and track the batches to verify the data integrity of the website.\\\\nCurrent design:\\\\nI am using the Page Object Model to abstract the page classes from the test classes. In addition, I have a Batch class with all the properties and getters/setters for most properties. In all applicable page classes, I have a scrapeBatch() method which scrapes the batch information and returns a new Batch() object with those properties set. I then have an equals(Batch) method defined for the Batch object to verify that there are no discrepancies between two batches. The scrapeBatch() methods for the page classes right now use setters to assign the properties to a new Batch() object. In addition, different pages on the website display different properties.\\\\nGoal:\\\\nI would like to not have to use all the getters and setters to make the code more concise and to reuse more code wherever possible. I have read that using interfaces is the way to go, but I am having difficulty understanding how to define those interfaces in the most logical way. Any suggestions for ways to refactor my code would be greatly appreciated. I would be able to expand more on this too, if that is needed.\\\\nI am required to build automated functional tests for an older web application which does not have much in the way of services or API. Normally that would mean using something like Selenium and interacting through a browser, but the automation has to go through our continuous integration, so it can\\\\\\'t run through the browser UI. \\\\nWe are using Jules for CI and build, and the automation has to succeed for the build to pass. Our team is trained in Selenium automation.\\\\nI don\\\\\\'t know where to start. What tools are there to perform functional testing against an application that doesn\\\\\\'t have an API when there is no way to open a browser and test with it?\\\\nI am building an android app to be used in rural areas (Saharan Africa, waaaay off the grid). The mobile app pulls down maps and map info from a server, uses the data, creates some new data (takes pictures, records GPS coordinates, etc), and then sends the data back to the server. We\\\\\\'ve done our best to allow full function offline and to coordinate upload attempts with a network listener.\\\\nIn August, we have a client who wants to roll this out to 1000 field workers in one shot, in rural Ghana. I\\\\\\'d like to hear thoughts about best practices for testing online-offline-poor connection systems as well as other thoughts regarding systems built to function in rural areas.\\\\nAlso, I\\\\\\'m worried about rolling a system out to 1000 users at once.

There is also a twodimensional string array somewhere that contains the links between the numbers 1, 3, 4 5 and a localization variable for their string representation in English, German and French, which are in resource files somewhere.\\\\nI then have a REST API call on /factory/{id:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\d+} that returns <factory><view>%did:%sid</view></factory>, where factory is whatever FACTORY_NAME is, view is whatever VIEW_NAME is, %did is whatever number you entered as a path parameter and can be either, 1, 3, 4 or 5 as a number, and %sid is a localized representation of that number (so one, ein, un; three, drei, trois; four, vier, quatre; five, f\\\\xc3\\\\xbcnf, cinq). Note that the actual code is many times more complicated with hundreds of API endpoints that do far more complicated things, this is just an example.\\\\nIn the above contrived example, there are essentially 3 things I want to test: \\\\n\\\\nThat the /factory/{id:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\d+} endpoint exists;\\\\nThat any id number I enter in the above endpoint is in the expected response value, and that it\\\\\\'s in the allowed values for the id property;\\\\nThat the response XML is what I expect it to be.\\\\n\\\\nThere are other things to test, but these will do for this example.\\\\nBased on the above example, to what extent should this test use hardcoded values and/or iteration to test that this code returns the expected values?\\\\n\\\\nShould I write 4 separate assertions that a GET to the factory endpoint gives an expected value, with the contacted endpoint hardcoded and comparing the XML response to the string above, hardcoded in the test? This seems kinda brittle since any change will break my test and I\\\\\\'ll have a lot of repeated code.\\\\nShould I write 4 separate assertions as above, again with the factory endpoint hardcoded, but then using Xpath to retrieve the variable part and then comparing this to a hardcoded value?\\\\nShould I write 4 separate assertions, but with everything that\\\\\\'s possibly variable being retrieved from the rest of my codebase?\\\\nShould I iterate over my localized string array and do an assert for each item in the array?\\\\nShould I do something else?\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m not sure what to do. Using the existing variables removes a lot of manually changing my tests when I change something, but it also means that I\\\\\\'m just checking if my values are processed correctly by my code and not if the values themselves are correct. Are there any generally accepted best practices for this scenario?\\\\nfrom selenium import webdriver\\\\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\\\\n\\\\n# create a new Firefox

My literal job on this is solely unit-testing, documenting the code under test, and of course reporting any fails with the rest of the dev team. \\\\nThere\\\\\\'s a few methods under test that hit other methods under test, that may hit others, that I\\\\\\'m responsible for testing. For example, at the time of me writing this, I\\\\\\'m trying to test this method:\\\\n//SendRequest This is used to contact the apiserver synchronously.\\\\nfunc (apiPath *APIPath) SendRequest(context interface{}, tokenHandler *apiToken.APITokenHandlerSt,\\\\n    header map[string]string,\\\\n    urlParams []string, urlQueries url.Values,\\\\n    jsonBody []byte) apiCore.CallResultSt {\\\\n    if apiToken := tokenHandler.GetToken(apiPath.AuthType, apiPath.Scope); apiToken != nil {\\\\n        return apiPath.APICoreHandler.SendRequest(\\\\n            context,\\\\n            apiToken.Token,\\\\n            apiPath.GetPath(urlParams, urlQueries), apiPath.Type,\\\\n            header, jsonBody)\\\\n    } else {\\\\n        errMsg, _ := json.Marshal(errors.InvalidAuthentication())\\\\n        return apiCore.CallResultSt{DetailObject: errMsg, IsSucceeded: false}\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nwhere the receiver struct is defined to be \\\\n//APIPath=======================\\\\n//Used for url construction\\\\ntype APIPath struct {\\\\n    APICoreHandler *apiCore.APICoreSt\\\\n    // domain name of API\\\\n    DomainPath string\\\\n    ParentAPI  *APIPath\\\\n    Type       apiCore.APIType\\\\n    // subfunction name\\\\n    SubFunc          string\\\\n    KeyName          string\\\\n    AutoAddKeyToPath bool\\\\n    AuthType         oAuth2.OAuth2Type\\\\n    Scope            string\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nNote that method has an external dependency.

I was merely asking to refactor it so that it hits an interface method, declared in the same file as the dependency, which those struct methods would implement (implementing interfaces is implicit in Golang).  It turned into a bit of an argument, and he brought the talking point \"What do you do about third-party dependencies and built-in dependencies?\" I told him that there\\\\\\'s usually a way to test-double those concerns out (fakes, mocks, stubs), but he wouldn\\\\\\'t budge.\\\\nWhat to do about this situation to convince him that this refactoring is indeed necessary, and failing that, what should I do about this situation?\\\\nUPDATE: The method under test has other business dependencies, defined thus: \\\\n// GetToken returns the token having the specified `tokenType` and `scope`\\\\n//\\\\n// Parameters:\\\\n// - `tokenType`\\\\n// - `scope`\\\\n//\\\\n// Returns:\\\\n// - pointer to Token having `tokenType`,`scope` or nil\\\\nfunc (ath *APITokenHandlerSt) GetToken(tokenType oAuth2.OAuth2Type, scope string) *APITokenSt {\\\\n    if ath == nil {\\\\n        return nil\\\\n    }\\\\n    if i := ath.FindToken(tokenType, scope); i == -1 {\\\\n        return nil\\\\n    } else {\\\\n        return &ath.Tokens[i]\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n// FindToken finds token with specified `scope` and `tokenType`\\\\n//\\\\n// Parameters:\\\\n// - `tokenType` :  the `OAuth2Type` of the token we want\\\\n// - `scope`: the scope of the token we want\\\\n//\\\\n// Returns:\\\\n// - the index of the token in ath.Tokens, or -1 if it cannot be found\\\\nfunc (ath *APITokenHandlerSt) FindToken(tokenType oAuth2.OAuth2Type, scope string) int {\\\\n    for i, t := range ath.Tokens {\\\\n        if t.TokenType == tokenType &&\\\\n            t.Scope == scope {\\\\n            return i\\\\n        }\\\\n    }\\\\n    return -1\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nI am unable to identify element. please find my below code.\\\\nWebElement editorFrame = dr.findElement(By.id(\"1536219451331-0-uiGrid-000L-cell\"));\\\\n\\\\nWhich one is the better option for web application testing - JBehave or Robot Framework?\\\\nComparison between JBehave and Robot Framewrok.\\\\nWhile clicking on UI-automatorviewer I\\\\\\'m getting below error:\\\\n/Users/XXXX/Library/Android/sdk/tools/bin/uiautomatorviewer ; exit;\\\\n-Djava.ext.dirs=/Users/bigdaddy/Library/Android/sdk/tools/lib/x86_64:/Users/XXXX/Library/Android/sdk/tools/lib is not supported.

Once my current spec is done running I\\\\\\'m calling a page object function to delete all the components to clean up the workspace before moving on to the next spec. I\\\\\\'d say about 50% of the time I\\\\\\'m noticing a stale element reference error on the line with my .filter() function. I added some log statements to see if I could figure out what\\\\\\'s happening and noticed some behavior I didn\\\\\\'t understand. It seems like for every component in my list, the filter function is running four times. Anyone know if this is expected behavior? \\\\nThis is my delete function:\\\\npublic async deleteAllComponents(): Promise<void> {\\\\n    await this.componentsTab.click();\\\\n\\\\n    // get list of all current components\\\\n    const components = element.all(this.projectComponentsLocator);\\\\n    const componentNames = await components.getText();\\\\n\\\\n    // delete each component\\\\n    for (const name of componentNames) {\\\\n        await this.deleteComponentFromProjTree(name);\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nThis is the function that is throwing the stale element reference error:\\\\npublic async deleteComponentFromProjTree(componentName: string): Promise<void> {\\\\n    await this.componentsTab.click();\\\\n    // get new list each time because list goes stale after a component is deleted\\\\n    const components = element.all(this.projectComponentsLocator);        \\\\n\\\\n    log(\\\\\\'components found:\\\\\\', await components.count());\\\\n    log(\\\\\\'deleting component:\\\\\\', componentName);\\\\n\\\\n    const relevantComponent = await components.filter((component: ElementFinder) => {\\\\n        return component.getText().then((text: string) => {\\\\n            log(\\\\\\'current component:\\\\\\', text);\\\\n            log(\\\\\\'relevant component found:\\\\\\', text.includes(componentName));\\\\n            return text.includes(componentName);\\\\n        });\\\\n    })\\\\n    .first();\\\\n\\\\n    await relevantComponent.click();\\\\n\\\\n    const componentMenu = relevantComponent.$(this.componentMenuLocator);\\\\n    await componentMenu.click();\\\\n\\\\n    if (await this.deleteOption.isPresent()) {\\\\n        await this.deleteOption.click();\\\\n        await this.confirmDeleteBtn.click();\\\\n    } else {\\\\n        // component cannot be deleted so just exit menu\\\\n        browser.actions().sendKeys(protractor.Key.ESCAPE).perform();\\\\n    }\\\\n};\\\\n\\\\nWhen I turn on the debug logging here is what I see in the console. Why does it seem like each component is running through the filter function 4 times? When there were 2 components found the function ran 8 times, when there was only 1 it still ran 4 times. What\\\\\\'s this all about?\\\\n\\\\nWithin a test suite, each test case generates a large amount of test data, which is used as input to the next test case in the sequence. Frequently we want to manipulate the test data to cause failures in or otherwise test the downstream tools. These manipulations are significant test activities whose outputs can be reused in other test suites, so I\\\\\\'d like to track them separately from the test cases.\\\\nSince the test activities themselves have similar fields to the test cases (precondition, postcondition, etc.) my naive inclination is to capture them alongside test cases (TC), with a different identifier (TA), in the same spreadsheet:\\\\n\\\\n(Additional fields, not shown, are Traceability, Input, Steps, Actual Output, Test Result, and Status.)\\\\nFurther extending my naive inclinations, I could add preparation/automation activities and track these separately. For all intents and purposes, we can assume this is captured in an Excel spreadsheet or similar and that we can add any fields we need.\\\\n\\\\nThis seems fairly nonstandard, so I appreciate any thoughts/alternatives. \\\\nI\\\\\\'m automating an app and using winappdriver tool with java language for the same.

Is there any way we can wait for the scroll event to finish before executing click?\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s just a little issue, but one that pops up in my mind regularly when writing test scripts.\\\\nImagine you have an application which does some car tax calculation, having a REST service which has a method for calculating the tax and an HTML interface with a screen to enter the required input and display the tax to pay. The HTML interface makes uses of the REST service and does nothing more than some input validation, passing the values to the REST interface and then display the tax to pay.\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s assume you developed several service tests for the REST service, e.g. using SoapUI, some with invalid input (weight=0kg or price=\\\\xe2\\\\x82\\\\xac0) and one with valid input (weight=900kg, price=\\\\xe2\\\\x82\\\\xac25000).\\\\nThe HTML interface is tested for usability, browser compatibility and other relevant quality attributes, which do not apply for the service test. The system test, e.g. using Protractor, contains some test cases concerning input validation, like an empty field for the weight of the car. You also want to verify if the tax calculation displays the correct amount to pay for valid input. Would you use the same test data as used in the service test, because you have the expected results already available, or would you deliberately choose different test data in order to implicitly test the business logic more thoroughly?\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s assume two situations:\\\\n\\\\nYou know the unit tests concerning the tax calculation have a\\\\ncoverage of about 80% and you know the developers are aware of techniques like equivalence partitioning. A decent base for the \\\\ntest pyramid.\\\\nThe unit tests concerning the tax calculation have a\\\\ncoverage of just 40% and there is no time and budget to write more unit\\\\ntests and raise the coverage, unfortunately, a common situation.\\\\n\\\\nIn the latter situation, you could, of course, extend the service tests to increase coverage on a higher level, but even then you have to decide if you want to deliberately use different input values for the system test. \\\\nI am trying to print product details from searched results from this page.\\\\nThis is the function I used for that.\\\\n@Test(priority = 1)\\\\npublic void printSearchItem() {\\\\n\\\\n    // print the product details\\\\n    java.util.List<WebElement> products = driver.findElements(By.className(\"sresult lvresult clearfix li\"));\\\\n\\\\n    for(WebElement product:products) {\\\\n\\\\n        System.out.println(product.getText());

Does anyone know of a better way to do this?  I am looking for a way to instantiate a more lifelike HttpApplication object and don\\\\\\'t mind a little complexity.\\\\nJavaScript is everywhere right now. With the advent of jQuery and other associated JavaScript frameworks it\\\\\\'s amazingly simple to add very powerful user interactions to web sites and web applications. However, with the addition of JavaScript and AJAX the movement away from HTTP and into a more asynchronous pattern has created new challenges. \\\\nCertainly you could use, Selenium. But what other frameworks have people used? I\\\\\\'m currently interested in things like:\\\\n\\\\nPhantomJS\\\\nEnvJS\\\\nPyQT\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"Is this going to be a stand-up fight sir, or a bug hunt?\"\\\\n  - Hudson\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve always wondered what the secrets were to writing a great bug report. Over time I\\\\\\'ve narrowed down the activity to three basic elements. \\\\n\\\\nReplicate: Once you\\\\\\'ve found the bug, replicate it.\\\\nDocument: Write it down, pack in detail where necessary.\\\\nCommunicate: Input it into the bug tracker and tell someone.\\\\n\\\\nReplicate - Clearly this is the most hated step because you just made something break, why should we break it again? Unfortunately, it\\\\\\'s part of the process. Bugs that are repeatable often give the development/implementation team a very clear view into what might be going wrong. A bug that happens one time can be very hard to track down. So, your first step if you find something wrong is to try and make it happen again. This is why it\\\\\\'s critical that you mentally keep track of what you\\\\\\'re doing and what you\\\\\\'ve clicked. Certain combinations can yield bugs, while others won\\\\\\'t.\\\\nDocument - The only thing worse than a bug is a bug without any details. For example, what\\\\\\'s wrong with the following bug report?\\\\n\\\\nMy order failed. I think it is broken.\\\\n\\\\nAside from the fact that your order failed, there\\\\\\'s no detail! Examples of very excellent detail:\\\\n\\\\nSteps to repeat the bug (see Step 1)\\\\nWhat you were expecting vs. what you got\\\\nError messages that appear on the page\\\\nWhat browser/operating system were you using\\\\n\\\\nSo if you were to rewrite the bug like the following - this will make it easier for the implementation team to investigate and solve the issue:\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m using the following:\\\\n  OS: Mac OS X (10.4.9)\\\\n  Browser: Firefox 2.0.0.3\\\\nMy order for a snuggle puppies on yoursitehere.com wouldn\\\\\\'t go\\\\n  through and I\\\\\\'m not sure why. When I try to place the order, I end up on\\\\n  the order entry page with the following error message: \"We\\\\\\'re sorry, our\\\\n  records indicate another order has already been placed....\"\\\\n  I was expecting to end up on the receipt page with a confirmation message\\\\n  and with a confirmation email in my inbox and instead I\\\\\\'m getting an error.\\\\nTry the following steps:\\\\nYour steps here\\\\n\\\\nCommunicate - In order for a bug to get corrected, the implementation team needs to know about it. This doesn\\\\\\'t end up being as plodding as it sounds. But the sooner you let your primary developer/project manager/testing know the sooner it can be put into the queue to be fixed.\\\\nThis is how I\\\\\\'ve done it ... but what makes a great bug report in your mind? \\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m building a solo project myself. (Java backend, Java AWT frontend. No lectures about AWT vs swing vs *wt, please :-))\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s fairly straightforward\\\\nPrimary server - keeps user information\\\\nContent server - keeps content information\\\\nClient - the user interface\\\\nClient opens up and connects to the primary server. Depending on the content, the connection gets bounced to the proper content server (of course, the primary and content servers do some communication to prepare the authorization of the new client coming in.)\\\\nAt what point should I be writing tests? I want to balance the testing aspect of it with making progress in development, and I\\\\\\'m not sure what the proper balance of that is. I\\\\\\'m much more concerned about the front end than I am about the back end. I pretty much see the GUI as a simple mechanism for calling back-end functionality with a lot of cool pictures. :-)\\\\nObviously there are paradigms like TDD which would dictate no code is written without a test. But this is just my moonlighting project that I do in my spare time. It\\\\\\'s mostly for fun (although I\\\\\\'d love to see a profit off it.)\\\\nThere\\\\\\'s currently between 30-40 classes. There are currently no tests of any kind (unit, functional, integration are what I plan to do eventually.)\\\\n\\\\nHow do I know when the right time to stop development and put some tests together is?\\\\n\\\\nI have a project that has almost complete unit test coverage. There\\\\\\'s only one statement that isn\\\\\\'t covered and I can\\\\\\'t work out a good way to do so. Say the project is called foo, I have foo/commands.py:\\\\n#!/usr/bin/python\\\\n[...]\\\\ndef main(argv):\\\\n    [...]\\\\n\\\\nif __name__ == \\\\\\'__main__\\\\\\':\\\\n    return main(sys.argv) # This line allegedly not covered by tests\\\\n\\\\nI do have a test for it! foo/tests/test_commands.py:\\\\nimport unittest\\\\nclass CommandsTest(unittest.TestCase):\\\\n    def test_direct_call(self):\\\\n        proc = subprocess.Popen([\\\\\\'python\\\\\\', \\\\\\'foo/commands.py\\\\\\', \\\\\\'help\\\\\\'], stdout=PIPE)\\\\n        stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()\\\\n        self.assertTrue(stdout.startswith(\\\\\\'usage:\\\\\\'))\\\\n        self.assertEquals(0, proc.returncode)\\\\n\\\\n(That\\\\\\'s not my actual test, but it\\\\\\'s along those lines.)\\\\nI use nose as my test runner:\\\\nnosetests --cover-erase --cover-tests --with-coverage --cover-package=foo -vs foo\\\\n\\\\nThe problem is that this particular statement isn\\\\\\'t considered \"covered\", because I use plain python instead of coverage.py (or python-coverage as its called on Ubuntu). I could change it to python-coverage, but I don\\\\\\'t really want to do that:\\\\n\\\\nIt may not be available.\\\\nIf it is available, it may be named differently.\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s ok if someone wants to run the test suite without the coverage stuff.\\\\n\\\\nRight now, I have a dreadful hack to do it:\\\\ninterpreter = \\\\\\'coverage\\\\\\' in sys.modules [\\\\\\'python-coverage\\\\\\', \\\\\\'run\\\\\\'] or [\\\\\\'python\\\\\\']\\\\n\\\\nNot exactly the most readable code, but imagine the irony of using the more readable approach:\\\\nif \\\\\\'coverage\\\\\\' in sys.modules:\\\\n    interpreter = [\\\\\\'python-coverage\\\\\\', \\\\\\'run\\\\\\']\\\\nelse:\\\\n    interpreter = [\\\\\\'python\\\\\\']\\\\n\\\\n...only to realise that the \"else:\" branch ends up not getting called when coverage is enabled, so I just have another line of code that\\\\\\'s not exercised by unit tests.\\\\nMy goal is to fail the test suite if there isn\\\\\\'t 100% coverage. I \"need\" the statement in foo/commands.py because it\\\\\\'s a very convenient way to test things during development (in actual installs, it\\\\\\'ll use distutils console_scripts magic to call into this file).\\\\nIdeas? Prior art? Anything?\\\\nNote: 100% coverage is by no means a guarantee that everything is great. Less than 100% is a guarantee, though, that there\\\\\\'s something you\\\\\\'re not testing. I can easily verify the 100% coverage, so I see no reason not to.\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve had a quick read around this subject and it looks like Action Recordings can be made in Internet Explorer 9 and then played back with fast forward. However my question is about recordings made in earlier versions of Internet Explorer.\\\\nBefore I upgrade to IE9 can anyone confirm for me that my Action Recordings that I made in IE8 with Test Manager will indeed work in IE9 (without having to re-record and adjust anything significantly).\\\\nI\\\\\\'m trying to learn more about software testing, so I want to know which books you would recommend on this topic\\\\nI\\\\\\'m currently working (almost finishing) a Java project that consists on a server application and some client applications on the same network, that will communicate with the server only to request informations. So what tools are suggested to use for this kind of testing?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m interested in hearing suggestions for ways of recording exploratory test session notes.  We currently use a mixture of Session Tester and a wiki for recording test notes.\\\\nI like many things about Session Tester: it\\\\\\'s unobtrusive and lightweight so it doesn\\\\\\'t get in the way and distract me from my testing, it\\\\\\'s cross-platform, and I very much like being able to tag \"issues\" for later follow-up during testing, and having them conveniently gathered under one heading in the report afterwards. (Being able to search plaintext files for key words later is also very handy).\\\\nDrawbacks? It\\\\\\'s (as the name suggests) aimed at session based testing, and our exploratory sessions tend to be more threaded, and less about discrete sessions.  \\\\nSuppose you\\\\\\'re working with bright programmer, but every time you test the code you find a serious, obvious bugs. Things the programmer could have noticed if they did their own testing before checking in. \\\\nGreat testers are meant to do great work, and finding obvious bugs is both a waste of QA expertise and a slow way for the team to get things done.\\\\nHow do you tell a programmer to test their own code before checking in, instead of just \"chucking it over the wall\"? \\\\nJoel has his \"The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing (version 3.0)\", but that\\\\\\'s really for programmers. \\\\nHow should you go about interviewing testers?\\\\nWe ask programmers to program on a whiteboard; how you can you ask testers to test in an interview, in a way that tells you something useful about them?\\\\nPerhaps programmers have their own unit tests, perhaps as the result of doing Test-Driven Development. They run these tests very often; perhaps every few minutes, but at least a few times each day.\\\\nIn my experience, QA\\\\\\'s automated tests tend to go after bigger chunks of functionality and are therefore slower and usually less reliable than programmer\\\\\\'s unit tests. Still, there is a lot of value in getting the results of these tests in programmer\\\\\\'s hands as soon as possible.\\\\nShould QA push for programmers running QA\\\\\\'s automated tests? Should QA insist that all of their automated tests pass before checking in? Should the nightly build process include a run of QA\\\\\\'s automated tests?\\\\n(I wrote nightly build but that only makes sense if you have a nightly build. I suspect that many shops don\\\\\\'t have this. I suspect that how QA is done varies very widely, and that awareness of other ways of doing things is very limited.)\\\\n\\\\nThe \"Joel Test\" lists 12 items to look for in a software company:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDo you use source control?\\\\nCan you make a build in one step?\\\\nDo you make daily builds?\\\\nDo you have a bug database?\\\\nDo you fix bugs before writing new code?\\\\nDo you have an up-to-date schedule?\\\\nDo you have a spec?\\\\nDo programmers have quiet working conditions?\\\\nDo you use the best tools money can buy?\\\\nDo you have testers?\\\\nDo new candidates write code during their interview?\\\\nDo you do hallway usability testing?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\\\'re a tester looking for a testing job, is this the right set of things to look for?  \\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve got a Perl-based Selenium instance running on my Win7 workstation.  When I fire up a test script, I get an error \"Lock file still present!\"\\\\nCaused by org.openqa.selenium.server.browserlaunchers.FirefoxChromeLauncher$FileLockRemainedException: Lock file still present!

What metrics do you use? What tools do you use?\\\\nShould the tester check usability, security, reliability, anything else?\\\\nWhile writing UI automated tests, I\\\\\\'ve come across situations where test dependency looked like a must. For example, say I have two tests, where the second is dependent on the success of the first. I can add dependency (using TestNG) on the first test so that the second is executed only when the first succeeds.\\\\nBut most programmers (I suppose xUnit users) support independent tests. That is, instead of being dependent on the first test, the second would need to bring the system to the right state before executing. To achieve this, the second test might invoke some common methods which would do the same operations as that of the first.\\\\nThe problem I see with this approach is execution duplication. The first test is executed. Then the \"independent\" second test is executed (or it could be executed before the first, as there is no order of execution) which would essentially do the same things as the first test in order to bring the system back to a state where the second can be executed. So, this would take more time over all.\\\\nDo you write independent tests? If so, how do you cope up with execution time?\\\\nIn some companies, the testers are expected to do Quality Assurance.\\\\nIn my opinion, this is not the way to go.\\\\nTesters normally don\\\\\\'t have the mandate to push things thorugh on a higher level.\\\\nBecause of that, it is impossible to perform decent QA.\\\\n\\\\nQA should be done by a QA manager that consults the testers.\\\\n  What do you guys think?\\\\n\\\\nCan every test be done by automation?\\\\nOr is there anything that cannot be done by automation?\\\\n\\\\nis that a feasible idea? \\\\nwhat tools do you use?\\\\nwhat do you call this kind of testing?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSimilar to Tools for Server application testing, I\\\\\\'m looking for Python-related testing tools/software (as Python is my most frequently-used language).\\\\n\\\\nI would like to automate the testing with selenium - even when I am right now a beginner with automatic testing and especially selenium. Therefor I am working with Bromine 3 RC 2. \\\\n\\\\nIs there a way to test an web application each night and send an email with the status of the test? Would you use another tool instead of Bromine 3? What tools do you use in combination with Selenium?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI recently asked this question on a less active exchange and as a result didn\\\\\\'t get the range of opinions I was after so am repeating it here.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve been working as a tester for the last 6 months (in the UK) and I have just been asked by my employer to work towards the ISEB Certified Tester Foundation Level Book. My main source material is the following book  Click to check book.\\\\nI was hoping that I could get some input from people who have completed this certification in the past. Do you have any sage advice that I should stick to? or any best practices I should adopt while learning the material?\\\\n\\\\nI realize that this certification is unlikely to make me a better tester but it is something the company wants our testers to pursue, so in essence I would appreciate opinions on how to pass the test as quickly as possible.\\\\n\\\\nDoes anyone have any advice to share on how to successfully test BIG ETL or data warehouse applications?\\\\nI have my own ideas of-course, but there only appears to be one main article on line that covers the basics:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nData completeness. Ensures that all expected data is loaded.\\\\n\\\\nData transformation. Ensures that all data is transformed correctly according to business rules and/or design specifications.\\\\n\\\\nData quality. Ensures that the ETL application correctly rejects, substitutes default values, corrects or ignores and reports invalid data.\\\\n\\\\nPerformance and scalability. Ensures that data loads and queries perform within expected time frames and that the technical architecture is scalable.\\\\n\\\\nIntegration testing. Ensures that the ETL process functions well with other upstream and downstream processes.\\\\n\\\\nUser-acceptance testing. Ensures the solution meets users\\\\\\' current expectations and anticipates their future expectations.\\\\n\\\\nRegression testing. Ensures existing functionality remains intact each time a new release of code is completed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI have heard a lot of \"abuse\" about automated testing, especially UI bases automated tests. As UI is very fragile and prone to change (especially in agile shops). Personally my automated tests have given more confidence about working system than finding defects. \\\\n\\\\nWhat is your success ratio with automated UI tests? Or maybe how you define success with automated UI test?\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve recently started converting my automation suites from WatiN to Selenium2.  In both cases, I\\\\\\'ve been using C#.\\\\nAlthough these may seem like simple questions, I\\\\\\'ve been searching for answers for about 2 weeks with almost no success.\\\\n1) Is there a way to assert that an element exists?  I\\\\\\'ve had to resort to creating an abject and expecting an exception to be thrown if it doesn\\\\\\'t exist on the page.  In WatiN, it was as simple as: assert.isTrue(browser.textField(Find.ById(elementId)).exists);\\\\n2) Is there a way to assert that text is present on the page?  I\\\\\\'ve yet to find a work around for this.  In WatiN, my test would have been: assert.isTrue(browser.containsText(\"text\"));\\\\nThanks in advance.\\\\nI am looking for a test management product to structure our current manual testing. What I would like to it handle is:\\\\n\\\\nrecording of test cases, including parametrised ones;\\\\nhistorical analysis of trends: number of tests, duration, succes criteria;\\\\nability to \"feed\" test results, e.g. from automatic acceptance tests with Selenium;\\\\nability to open tasks in an issue tracker based on failed testing runs.\\\\n\\\\nThe price tag is obviously important, so free products are preferred. As we are a software company, an architecture which allows us to develop plugins is appreciated.\\\\nHaving a development background, I am convinced that record and replay testing tools have their drawbacks, especially by making tests brittle. See Automated Testing != Record-Playback Tool for a good summary:\\\\n\\\\nRecord-playback scripts are more expensive to maintain because the code they generate is long, complicated, not object oriented and must be further manipulated to put into reusable components.\\\\n\\\\nGiven that a stable framework is offered to QA , is it a reasonable expectation for them to code automated tests? I will obviously assume that they will have at least some programming background.\\\\n\\\\nUpdate: I am interested only in the QA bits specific to automated testing. I am very well aware of the benefits of manual, exploratory testing, but that is out of scope for this question.\\\\nTesting process involves plenty of documentation.

And, overall, how do you keep track of what issues have automated tests covering it and what not? \\\\nI am working with Selenium C# .NET.\\\\nWhat I want to accomplish is elegant, extendable page load time logging within my page object architecture. Most new pages are loaded as the result of some action, such as a click on a previous page. The problem is that when an action is performed, the WebDriver does not give control back to the Selenium code until the page has loaded. This causes the reported time elapsed to be much less than it actually is from a user perspective.\\\\nHere is some code that represents what I\\\\\\'m trying to do.\\\\nclass LoginPage : Page\\\\n{\\\\n    public WelcomePage Login()\\\\n    {\\\\n        EnterUserName();\\\\n        EnterPassword();\\\\n        // Really DON\\\\\\'T want to start a timer here and then access it in the Page constructor, if possible.\\\\n        ClickContinueButton(); // Performs driver.FindElement(continueButtonLocator).Click();\\\\n        return new WelcomePage();\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nclass WelcomePage : Page\\\\n{\\\\n    public override void WaitForLoad()\\\\n    {\\\\n        // Wait until some element exists to indicate page has completely loaded.\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nabstract class Page\\\\n{\\\\n    long loadTime;\\\\n\\\\n    // Base constructor\\\\n    // Start a timer, verify page load, and stop the timer.\\\\n    public Page()\\\\n    {\\\\n        // This isn\\\\\\'t called until the browser loading indicator has stopped.\\\\n        timer = StopWatch.StartNew();\\\\n        WaitForLoad();\\\\n        loadTime = timer.EllapsedMilliseconds;\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    protected abstract void WaitForLoad();\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nHas anyone else come up with a solution to this problem?\\\\nThe next-best solution I can think of right now is to have a global timer that restarts whenever an action like a click is performed. On the base Page class, I have generic methods for performing those actions, so one of those might look like this:\\\\npublic void ClickElement(By locator)\\\\n{\\\\n    IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(locator);\\\\n    GlobalTimer.Restart();\\\\n    element.Click();\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nAnd then the Page constructor would just access that after verifying load completion:\\\\npublic Page()\\\\n{\\\\n    WaitForLoad();\\\\n    loadTime = GlobablTimer.EllapsedMilliseconds;\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nI feel like there has to be a better way of doing this, but I haven\\\\\\'t come across a well-defined pattern in my searching.\\\\nI have created simple TestNG file with simple code to open chrome browser in IntelliJ IDEA but its throwing below error, please help me.\\\\nMy code:\\\\npublic class Sample{\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    @Test (priority = 0)\\\\n    public void testCase() throws Exception {\\\\n\\\\n    System.setProperty(\"webdriver.chrome.driver\", \"mypath\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\chromedriver.exe\");\\\\n    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\\\\n    driver.get(\"https://www.google.co.in/\");\\\\n\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nAnd below is Error:\\\\n\\\\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:\\\\n  org/openqa/selenium/remote/RenderedRemoteWebElement\\\\nat java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)    at\\\\n  java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:763)   at\\\\n  java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:142)\\\\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClass(URLClassLoader.java:467)     at\\\\n  java.net.URLClassLoader.access$100(URLClassLoader.java:73)    at\\\\n  java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:368)    at\\\\n  java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:362)    at\\\\n  java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)    at\\\\n  java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:361)    at\\\\n  java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)     at\\\\n  sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:335)     at\\\\n  java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357)     at\\\\n  TestCase.Sample.signIn(Sample.java:34)    at\\\\n  sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)   at\\\\n  sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\\\\n    at\\\\n  sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\\\\n    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)     at\\\\n  org.testng.internal.MethodInvocationHelper.invokeMethod(MethodInvocationHelper.java:84)\\\\n    at org.testng.internal.Invoker.invokeMethod(Invoker.java:714)   at\\\\n  org.testng.internal.Invoker.invokeTestMethod(Invoker.java:901)    at\\\\n  org.testng.internal.Invoker.invokeTestMethods(Invoker.java:1231)  at\\\\n  org.testng.internal.TestMethodWorker.invokeTestMethods(TestMethodWorker.java:127)\\\\n    at\\\\n  org.testng.internal.TestMethodWorker.run(TestMethodWorker.java:111)\\\\n    at org.testng.TestRunner.privateRun(TestRunner.java:767)    at\\\\n  org.testng.TestRunner.run(TestRunner.java:617)    at\\\\n  org.testng.SuiteRunner.runTest(SuiteRunner.java:334)  at\\\\n  org.testng.SuiteRunner.runSequentially(SuiteRunner.java:329)  at\\\\n  org.testng.SuiteRunner.privateRun(SuiteRunner.java:291)   at\\\\n  org.testng.SuiteRunner.run(SuiteRunner.java:240)  at\\\\n  org.testng.SuiteRunnerWorker.runSuite(SuiteRunnerWorker.java:52)  at\\\\n  org.testng.SuiteRunnerWorker.run(SuiteRunnerWorker.java:86)   at\\\\n  org.testng.TestNG.runSuitesSequentially(TestNG.java:1224)     at\\\\n  org.testng.TestNG.runSuitesLocally(TestNG.java:1149)  at\\\\n  org.testng.TestNG.run(TestNG.java:1057)   at\\\\n  org.testng.IDEARemoteTestNG.run(IDEARemoteTestNG.java:72)     at\\\\n  org.testng.RemoteTestNGStarter.main(RemoteTestNGStarter.java:123)\\\\n  Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:\\\\n  org.openqa.selenium.remote.RenderedRemoteWebElement   at\\\\n  java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:381)    at\\\\n  java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)     at\\\\n  sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:335)     at\\\\n  java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357)     ... 36 more\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s hard to understand how to handle test scenarios in testlink. we always hearing around,\\\\n - one test scenario may consist of many test cases \\\\n - one test case may include in many test scenarios (test case reusability).\\\\nin testlink, how we manage test scenarios?\\\\nI am working on an application that has been written in AngularJS.

At the start of the third test, the window is maximized and at the start of the fourth test, window size changes to the default size...etc.\\\\nThis occurred when using the latest version of WebDriver - GeckoDriver 0.18.0.\\\\nWith previous version of WebDriver, the browser window size has remained maximized during all tests.\\\\nAnd I use the latest version of web browser Firefox 55.0.3.\\\\nWith browser Chrome or IE it works well.\\\\nAll test scripts contains driver.Manage().Window.Maximize();\\\\nAny idea why this is happening?\\\\nAnd how to fix it?\\\\nRecently I got Visual studio Enterprises Subscription from my company and I was asked to prepare the system for testing,  With the help of support team somehow I manage to set up the system but during the research, I come across three terms:-\\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft Test Manager(MTM)\\\\nVisual Studio Test Professional\\\\nTeam Foundation Server (TFS)\\\\n\\\\nNow I am confused that in these three, Please explain me the difference between these & how can I use it for END to END Test Process for any general project?\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve recently stumbled upon this new (at least to me) testing type: Snapshot Testing:\\\\n\\\\nFor Facebook\\\\\\'s native apps we use a system called \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csnapshot testing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d: a snapshot test system that renders UI components, takes a screenshot and subsequently compares a recorded screenshot with changes made by an engineer. If the screenshots don\\\\\\'t match, there are two possibilities: either the change is unexpected or the screenshot can be updated to the new version of the UI component.\\\\n\\\\nHas anyone tried that? When is this type of testing applicable? Is this a replacement for unit testing or a just a way/style of writing them? Is it only applicable for the UI tests?\\\\nI am working on an AngularJS app, and am looking to add some automated testing to the development life cycle of the project.\\\\nAfter doing a bit of research, and asking on here about what frameworks would be best to use to enable the testing functionality that I require, I have decided to use Protractor as the testing framework for my app.\\\\nI am following the tutorial to try and get Protractor up and running with my application (i.e. with my existing app, not the Super Calculator application that the tutorial references), but am encountering a problem:\\\\nThe way my development environment is set up, is that I am doing all of the development of the AngularJS app on my local Windows machine, and using a Unix VM (running CentOS) to serve my app\\\\\\'s front-end using grunt.\\\\nI have run through the setup steps in the tutorial, and have all of that set up correctly.

After doing a bit of research, and asking for recommendations on here as to what the best framework to use would be for this application, I have decided to use Protractor.\\\\nI have gone through the tutorial on their website, to get an understanding for how it works & what it does, etc, and am now looking to start integrating it into the existing application, which I appreciate/ expect will be a bit more complicated than setting up the testing framework/ suite at the start of a project, & building it in parallel with the development of the application, as I will essentially have to go back through the application (and code), and document everything that will need to be tested, how it should be tested, pass/ fail criteria, etc.\\\\nFor now though, I just want to set up a couple of very simple tests to ensure that I have Protractor up and running with my app correctly. I can then look to design & implement the more thorough/ involved tests later, once I have the framework set up.\\\\nI want to set Protractor up for use within my development environment, but am having a bit of difficulty doing this... My environment is:\\\\n\\\\nWindows 10 PC\\\\nUnix VM running CentOS 7\\\\nPython 3.4 running the backend on the VM\\\\nUsing grunt serve to serve the front end on the VM\\\\n\\\\nI am following through the tutorial again, this time trying to apply it to my existing application, so that I can start writing tests for it.\\\\nI have the conf.js file written as indicated in the tutorial:\\\\nexports.config = {\\\\n    framework: \\\\\\'jasmine\\\\\\',\\\\n    seleniumAddress: \\\\\\'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\\\\\\',\\\\n    specs: [\\\\\\'spec.js\\\\\\'],\\\\n    multiCapabilities: {\\\\n        browserName: \\\\\\'firefox\\\\\\'\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nand have the spec.js file written as indicated in the tutorial, just with the address that the browser should point to set to the local address of my VM:\\\\ndescribe(\\\\\\'My App\\\\\\', function() {\\\\n    it(\\\\\\'should hit the VM hosted site\\\\\\', function() {\\\\n        browser.get(\\\\\\'192.168.1.212:8080\\\\\\');\\\\n\\\\n        //Write tests here\\\\n        //element(by.model(\\\\\\'toolbar-btn-on\\\\\\')).sendKeys(\\\\\\'write first app test\\\\\\');\\\\n        //element(by.css\\\\n\\\\n        //Test to get app title:\\\\n        expect(browser.getTitle()).toEqual(\\\\\\'title of my app\\\\\\');\\\\n    });\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\nThese files, & my whole application repository is stored on a network drive which I have mapped to both my local machine & the VM. \\\\nIf I open a browser on the VM, and browse to localhost:8080/#/pages/login, I am presented with the log in page for my AngularJS app.\\\\nIf I open a browser on my local windows machine, and browse to  192.168.1.212:8080/#/pages/login, I am presented with the same log in page for my AngularJS app, so it is clear that my app is up and running, Python is serving the back end, and Grunt is serving the front end, all working correctly.\\\\nHowever, when I run:\\\\nprotractor conf.js\\\\n\\\\nfrom the command line, as indicated at the end of \\\\\\'Step 0 - Write a test\\\\\\' in the tutorial, although the browser opens & closes again very quickly, as the tutorial indicates it should, it states that the output should say:\\\\n\\\\n1 tests, 1 assertion, 0 failures\\\\n\\\\nbut the output in my console actually shows:\\\\n\\\\n[15:16:09] I/launcher - Running 1 instances of WebDriver\\\\n  [15:16:09] I/hosted - Using the selenium server at http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\\\\nStarted\\\\nF\\\\nFailures:\\\\n1) App should hit the VM hosted site\\\\n    Message:\\\\n      Failed: invalid element state: Failed to execute \\\\\\'replace\\\\\\' on \\\\\\'Location\\\\\\': \\\\\\'192.168.1.212:8080\\\\\\' is not a valid URL.\\\\n        (Session info: chrome=60.0.3112.113)\\\\n        (Driver info: chromedriver=2.32.498550 (9dec58e66c31bcc53a9ce3c7226f0c1c5810906a),platform=Windows NT 10.0.15063 x86_64)\\\\n    Stack:\\\\n      InvalidElementStateError: invalid element state: Failed to execute \\\\\\'replace\\\\\\' on \\\\\\'Location\\\\\\': \\\\\\'192.168.1.212:8080\\\\\\' is not a valid URL.\\\\n...\\\\n1 spec, 1 failure\\\\nFinished in 0.121 seconds\\\\n[15:16:16] I/launcher - 0 instance(s) of WebDriver still running\\\\n[15:16:16] I/launcher - chrome #01 failed 1 test(s)\\\\n[15:16:16] I/launcher - overall: 1 failed spec(s)\\\\n[15:16:16] E/launcher - Process exited with error code 1\\\\n\\\\nSo it appears that my test doesn\\\\\\'t like the fact that I am asking it to \\\\\\'get\\\\\\' the browser at the VM\\\\\\'s IP address (i.e. not my local computer\\\\\\'s IP address). Is there a reason for this? How can I set Protractor to run my tests against a version of my application that\\\\\\'s hosted on the VM, rather than a live site, or a version hosted on my local development machine?\\\\nEnabling certain options on a page will generate a link that I need to store. The link is located in the page object file by element(by.css(\\\\\\'a[href*=\"link\"]\\\\\\')); I need to figure out how to store either the link located on the page or the link after it is clicked (the same URL). \\\\nSuggestions?\\\\nMotivated by this talk about the accidental unexpected pony dancing on the screen.\\\\nWe currently have a rather rich subset of end-to-end tests for our AngularJS applications. And, we do get a lot of visual/layout/design issues on every single development iteration. Usually, we do not cover this kind of issues with end-to-end tests and testing the fixes manually. The reasoning was always - too hard, too fragile, too expensive to automate.\\\\nIn some cases though, a style of an element or block on a page is really critical for an end-user and it would make sense to have an automated end-to-end test checking it. We try to check the colors, font styles and other CSS properties inside our Protractor tests, but it is still checking only these specific things and not an element or part of a page as a whole. Plus, the assertions themselves are not readable and easy to break, for example:\\\\nexpect(somePage.someElement.getCssValue(\"background-color\")).toEqual(\"rgba(255, 211, 205, 1)\");\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe are thinking of adding some sort of a visual component to our tests. Ideally, comparing screenshots of what we expect an element to look like and how it actually looks. But, there are a lot of open questions at this point:\\\\n\\\\nhow reliable can it be - would it depend on the browser, resolution and other parameters of the test machine setup?\\\\nis it possible to integrate with our existing Protractor test codebase or we need a separate specialized tool for that?\\\\ntest result reporting - how would we present the test results?\\\\n\\\\nHave you done something similar and how did you address the above mentioned issues?

But, a similar view is expressed in this article.\\\\nNext quote is from here:\\\\n\\\\nWhen compared to Explicit wait, Implicit wait is transparent and\\\\n  uncomplicated. The syntax and approach is simpler than explicit wait.\\\\n  Being easy and simple to apply, implicit wait introduces a few\\\\n  drawbacks as well. It gives rise to the test script execution time as\\\\n  each of the command would be ceased to wait for a stipulated amount of\\\\n  time before resuming the execution.\\\\n\\\\nQuestion:\\\\nIs it a bad practice to use implicit wait? Should one use only explicit wait?\\\\nNote: From the Selenium Documentation, it is clear that one should not use both the waits together.

I would like to work in a similar independent way, e.g., by automating tests per project.\\\\nIf there is something like that, where can I learn more about such career path and related experiences?\\\\nI wrote a few selenium test cases for testing a web application and then integrated the testcases using ANT build automation tool using build.xml. \\\\nThe output comes to the reports folder, but how can I see the results for all the testcases that I wrote? \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI currently have a large number of circumstances where I need to verify that a page (along with all of its elements) are displaying correctly. The isDisplayed() method of WebElement appears to be a logical way to do this, however I would like to understand precisely what this method is doing to determine whether or not an element \"is displayed\". The javadoc does not shed any light on the inner workings of the method and other information on the web appears to be sparse at best. \\\\nIf anyone could provide a detailed description of how this method works, I would be very grateful.\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve inherited a collection of desktop applications that currently have (for all intents) no automated test coverage.  Generally speaking, these applications are typically deployed as a suite, installed on different machines, and communicate via a complex, undocumented, and proprietary protocol.  They also communicate with vendors via socket or serial to send/receive data.\\\\nI want to introduce automated integration testing for these applications, but haven\\\\\\'t found many tools that advertise this feature.  TestComplete offers what they call \"distributed testing,\" but after using it in a free trial I\\\\\\'m not real impressed with how it works.  It just doesn\\\\\\'t seem to have this use case in mind.  I\\\\\\'m still working with SmartBear to see if there\\\\\\'s something that can simplify what I\\\\\\'m trying to do.\\\\nMy question: can anyone recommend a tool for testing a suite of applications across multiple machines, assuming that a test on one machine might require an action on another machine?  \\\\nI realize I should test in isolation and simulate/mock the other machines, but the communications between the machines is complicated enough that it\\\\\\'s a bit of a non-starter for me.  I can revisit this if there aren\\\\\\'t any great tools for doing this, but it no longer becomes a good integration test in my eyes.  I do intend to simulate the vendors\\\\\\' data feeds since they are generally simple and there\\\\\\'s no other option since we don\\\\\\'t have their software.\\\\nHTML rendering, Javascript and AJAX plays an important role in the development of modern web applications.\\\\nHow significant is JavaScript when designing test cases for a website that uses it?

We provide both desktop and web applications to our clients.  After doing a lot of research and testing, I landed on Selenium for the web tests because it seemed easiest and most powerful while still giving me total control over my tests.  For desktop applications, I initially landed on Visual Studio\\\\\\'s own Coded UI Tests, as it was the only GUI tester that gave consistent results.  However, Selenium uses NUnit and Coded UI tests use Microsoft\\\\\\'s own test framework.  My question is, is there a framework that I can use to run both web tests and GUI tests?  I\\\\\\'d prefer to continue to use Selenium if possible.  Most other GUI testing applications I\\\\\\'ve tried are inconsistent or don\\\\\\'t allow programming.  I can obviously just bypass the GUI and call our application\\\\\\'s methods directly, but if there is a way to test the GUI as well, that would be preferred.  Any suggestions that use C# would be particularly appreciated.  \\\\nI\\\\\\'m using the Selenium IDE to record my initial tests and then export them to c# and then use the webdriver.  Some things that I do from the IDE don\\\\\\'t export.  \\\\nI am trying to select a State from a drop-down text list.  I don\\\\\\'t have much background in HTML and am kind of new to C# also (I\\\\\\'ve programmed for a couple semesters in Java so far, c# for about a month.)  How would I go about selecting a specific state from the dropdown list?  \\\\nWe\\\\\\'ve setup the Jenkins-performance-plugin to run our JMeter tests automatically.  However we\\\\\\'ld also like to test the Web UI layer for performance.

I therefore downloaded that application, too, and modified the command as follows, to include the path to the different profile: \\\\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar \\\\n     -firefoxProfileTemplate C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\rplantik\\\\\\\\Portables\\\\\\\\selenium\\\\\\\\FirefoxPortable2ndProfile\\\\\\\\Data\\\\\\\\profile \\\\n     -htmlSuite \"*firefox C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\rplantik\\\\\\\\Portables\\\\\\\\selenium\\\\\\\\FirefoxPortable\\\\\\\\FirefoxPortable.exe\" \\\\n      \"http://127.0.0.1\"    \\\\n      \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\rplantik\\\\\\\\Portables\\\\\\\\selenium\\\\\\\\rest\\\\\\\\testsuite.html\" \\\\n      \"testresults.html\"\\\\n\\\\nNow it seems that the profile was created successfully (Preparing Firefox profile... seems to be executed as intended - for a short moment, the \"Firefox\" logo pops up), then the message Launching Firefox... appears, and indeed a firefox application is started. \\\\nBut after that, the test suite is not executed.

We used Hibernate to generate Java entities for both schema versions. Then, depending on which version we are testing, we are switching the classpath to those Java entities. This way we can use run the same test cases and use the same DB assertions in both 1.0 testing and 2.0. \\\\nThis approach resolves the problem at runtime. However, at compilation time, we got a problem:\\\\n\\\\nfor entities that are specific only for schema 1.0, tests/assertions for schema 2.0 fail to compile; and vice versa\\\\nfor entities that are common and same for both schema, there is no problem.\\\\n\\\\nIs branching our test cases and test framework in SVN the only approach to this problem? The same way devs branches the system?\\\\nThat will be put additional effort on us to maintain each branch.\\\\nEach of our end-to-end test cases checks two aspects/functionalities of message processing:\\\\n\\\\nWhether the message has been processed correctly (resulted in a correct action of the system).\\\\nWhether information about processing been correctly logged to DB (for further reporting purposes).\\\\n\\\\nWe decided to verify both aspects in a single case, because end-to-end tests takes much time (this is distributed system and message traverse through a number of slower, legacy systems).\\\\nNow, when assertions related to first functionality pass, and for the second will fail, it does not matter. All test cases are marked as failed, so the message sent to the management is that 100% of test cases failed, ignoring the fact, that the latter functionality is less important to our business. This is because wustomers won\\\\\\'t care having correct reports when processing is incorrect.\\\\nHow would you solve this?\\\\n\\\\nCreate separate test cases for different aspects? (more time to run the tests) OR\\\\nConfigure TestNG to create separate reports for each functionality/group of assertions? (if so, then how?)\\\\n\\\\nUpdate: Having correct reports when processing is incorrect is useful only to us for troubleshooting. That is one another reason why we decided to combine checking both aspects in one test.\\\\nOur DBA is very eager to help us with monitoring DB status. We had recently some problems with buggy deployments scripts (both manual and automated) that set up DB incorrectly or incompletely. So his idea is to have SELECT queries that will check the status of DB to provide quick feedback, e.g.\\\\nSELECT count(*) > 0 FROM user_table;\\\\n\\\\nObviously, many DB problems will be discovered by end-to-end tests, but having a number of tests cases checking directly DB will help us with troubleshooting and shorten the feedback loop.\\\\nI would like to add such DB checks as Jenkins jobs and provide to DBA some way (natural for him) to express such test cases. I found two approaches to do that:\\\\n\\\\nTranslate SQL queries to JUnit tests, e.g. using DBAssert library:\\\\n//Set condition to search record by. \\\\ndbAssert.table(\"authors\").where(\"id\", 123).and(\"last_name\", \"Coupland\") ; \\\\n\\\\n// assert customers _name_ column equals Douglas value in database.\\\\ndbAssert.assert_column(\"name\", \"Douglas\");\\\\n\\\\nEmbed SQL queries into bash scripts, as proposed here:\\\\n#!/bin/bash -l\\\\nCHECK=`mysql -u jenkins -ppassword -h 192.168.56.101 -BNe \\\\\\'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo_db.jobs WHERE depth >= 100\\\\\\'`\\\\nexit ${CHECK}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe choice will depend on our DBA, obviously. Though, I believe, the second approach is easier as it requires no Java skills.\\\\nAny other ideas?\\\\nHow do you mentally deal with this? For example im testing on a \"Virtual\" Environment of the customers set up....but a lot of things are simulated either due to not having the equipment etc...\\\\nWhen small issues come back I beat myself up over it.\\\\nHow do I get past the fact that im never going to be able to find everything?\\\\nHow to perform Selenium navigation before tests run without using JUnit 4.11+\\\\\\'s setUp or at the start of the test method?\\\\nWe\\\\\\'ve got both navigation and bookmark based Selenium tests.  The test code for the page under test is in a separate method that is called by test methods ending in either Bookmark or Nav.  Navigation to the page under test is called from the setUp method, but exceptions that occur when navigating don\\\\\\'t get treated as test failures because they are running in setUp.  An easy solution that we don\\\\\\'t like would be adding a call to the navigation method as the first line of each Nav test.

Then it sends details about the response from the user in a CSV file in a shared sftp location. \\\\nTo test our system, I was looking to bypass this third party completely and create a fake system but I am not sure how one can fake a call. \\\\nPresently how we manually test is we create an user, send our own phone number so that we can get a call and answer them according to the test cases. Based on our test case we see whether we got the expected result back in csv. \\\\nDoes any one has any better way of doing this and save time in manual process.\\\\nIts complicated, and I might not have explained it properly.  So if you have any questions, I will try to explain it in more detail.\\\\nI am looking into ways of managing my automated tests through some kind of framework or management tool.

I have a script which clicks a button which opens in a new window.  I\\\\\\'m able to switch to that new window but only intermittently.  Here\\\\\\'s my code:\\\\n    mainWindowHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();\\\\n    objAdminPage.clickButtonForNewWindow();\\\\n\\\\n    Set<String> handles = driver.getWindowHandles();\\\\n    System.out.println(handles);\\\\n    System.out.println(\"This is the main handle \" + mainWindowHandle);\\\\n\\\\n    for(String winHandle : handles){\\\\n        System.out.println(\"In the loop \" + handles);\\\\n        if(!winHandle.equals(mainWindowHandle)){    \\\\n            driver.switchTo().window(winHandle);    \\\\n            System.out.println(winHandle);\\\\n        }\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\nThis seems to be the standard way of doing things.  The script saves the current window handle, then gets all handles, loops over them until it finds the one which isn\\\\\\'t the current window and the driver switches to it.  And this works.....sort of.  Often when I run the script it won\\\\\\'t switch to the new window, leading to failed tests and badness.  I\\\\\\'ve scattered sysouts through the code as you can see and I\\\\\\'ve noticed that on failure I\\\\\\'m only getting one handle in the handles set, not both.  What seems to be happening is that the system is charging ahead and the set is being created before Selenium can get both handles.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m able to get this to run reliably if I make a Thread.sleep(1000) call prior to creating the set but I really don\\\\\\'t like having to do this.  It seems inelegant and I\\\\\\'ve not seen this being necessary elsewhere.

I\\\\\\'m using Selenium for Java, version 2.42.2, with IE Driver.\\\\nMy code currently manages all other flows and single pop ups windows, but when a second level popup appears my webdriver object gets irresponsive and just stuck in any method that try to get invoked. When this happens, I need to manually close the popup window and then driver method continues the execution of invoked method.\\\\nMaybe it worth mentioning, if I call the second popup from the main page (not from another popup) I am able to manage it without problems, so the problem seems to be related with the number of nested windows more than a specific problem for the page.\\\\nTake a look on below code:\\\\nString url = \"/example.jsp\"\\\\nint counter = 0;\\\\nboolean windowDetected = false;\\\\n\\\\n// Waiting until page with given url gets detected\\\\n// It tries 10 times before it continues\\\\nwhile (counter++ < 10 && !windowDetected) {         \\\\n\\\\n  waitForSeconds(1); // Just invokes Thread.sleep method, \\\\n\\\\n  System.out.println(\"before getting handlers, iteration \" + counter + \" of 10\");   \\\\n  Set<String> handlers = driver.getWindowHandles();\\\\n  System.out.println(\"after getting handlers, number of handlers: \" + handlers.size());\\\\n\\\\n  for (String handler : handlers) {\\\\n\\\\n    try {\\\\n      System.out.println(\"Moving to \" + handler);\\\\n      driver.switchTo().window(handler);\\\\n    }\\\\n    catch (NoSuchWindowException e) {\\\\n      System.out.println(\"Window not found, it probably redirected to a different window\");\\\\n      break;\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    if (driver.getCurrentUrl().contains(url)) {\\\\n      windowDetected = true;\\\\n      waitForPageLoading(); // It just verify current page status to be completed\\\\n      break;\\\\n    }\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nI am able to position properly the driver in specific window with above code in other application pages, but when having the second level popup it just hangs on line Set handlers = driver.getWindowHandles(); that is the first method called on driver object after popup appeared. Similarly, if I had called another driver method like driver.getPageSource() the same would have happened in that method.\\\\nI am not able to change application structure (my scope is only for testing it), so doing changes in web application code is not an option for me now. I have read on different options like trying Robot class, but I think it will be difficult to implement with more complex pages and difficult to maintain.\\\\nAny idea of how can I solve this issue?

Is there any way I could record these scripts?\\\\nJmeter has a webdriver sampler. We have to write the scripts. We have scripts written in opkey, a selenium based tool. Can we integrate both of them. So that we don\\\\\\'t have to write scripts in jmeter.\\\\nFor one of my uni projects I have to test and compare how different protocols handle audio and video data transfer.

The test currently looks like this:\\\\nit(\\\\\\'should display the Pages menu\\\\\\', function() {\\\\n    browser.actions().mouseMove(pagesMenuBtn).perform();\\\\n    browser.pause();\\\\n    expect(pageVarBrowser.isDisplayed()).toBeTruthy();\\\\n    browser.pause();\\\\n    browser.actions().mouseMove(userCircle).perform();\\\\n    browser.pause();\\\\n    expect(pageVarBrowser.isDisplayed()).toBeFalsy();\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\npagesMenuBtn is the menu button that will display a sub-menu listing the rest of the pages of the application when the user hovers the cursor over it- it has been defined with:\\\\nvar pagesMenuBtn = element(by.id(\\\\\\'.nav-container > model[type=href] > value[\"#/pages\"]\\\\\\'));\\\\n\\\\npageVarBrowser is one of the buttons that is displayed on the sub-menu shown when hovering the cursor over pagesMenuBtn, and is defined with:\\\\nvar pageVarBrowser = element(by.css(\\\\\\'.nav-container > model[type=href] > value[\"#/pages/varbrowser\"]\\\\\\'));\\\\n\\\\nuserCircle is simply another HTML element displayed in a different location on the page (just so that I could move the cursor somewhere off the pagesMenuBtn), and has been defined with:\\\\nvar userCircle = element(by.id(\\\\\\'icon-user-circle\\\\\\'));\\\\n\\\\nThis doesn\\\\\\'t appear to be an issue with the syntax/ logic of the tests I\\\\\\'ve written/ am writing, but when I currently run my tests with the command protractor conf.js, the script starts up, and starts running through correctly, but when it reaches the above test, I get the following output in the console:\\\\n\\\\nError: Timeout = Async callback was not invoked within timeout specified by jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL. \\\\n\\\\nDoes this mean that my tests have failed because they took too long to execute? If so, how can I fix this? Can I change the \\\\\\'timeout\\\\\\' variable to a greater value?\\\\nIn the console where I ran the command protractor conf.js, I get the following error message about the failure:\\\\n\\\\nA Jasmine spec timed out.

I removed the calls to browser.pause(); as mentioned in my earlier edit, and then started getting the error message above instead. I suspect that this is due to the location of the element that I\\\\\\'m trying to find/ the structure of the HTML in which it\\\\\\'s nested. That HTML is:\\\\n<li data-ng-mouseenter=\"setMenuTop($event)\" ng-show=\"menu.pages.length > 0 || menu.upages.length > 0 || canCreatePage\">\\\\n    <a href=\"#/pages\" id=\"pagesMenuBtn\" target=\"_self\"><i class=\"ti-layers\"></i><span data-i18n=\"Pages\"></span></a>\\\\n        <ul class=\"text-capitalize\">\\\\n            <li ng-repeat=\"page in menu.pages\"><a href=\"#/{{page.location}}\" target=\"_self\"><i class=\"ti-angle-right\"></i><span data-i18n=\"{{page.title}}\"></span></a></li>\\\\n            <li ng-repeat=\"upage in menu.upages\">\\\\n                <div class=\"nav-menu-divider\" data-ng-if=\"$index === 0\"></div>\\\\n                <a href=\"#/{{upage.location}}\" target=\"_self\">\\\\n                    <i class=\"ti-angle-right\"></i><span data-i18n=\"{{upage.title}}\"></span>\\\\n                </a>\\\\n            </li>\\\\n            <li data-ng-show=\"canCreatePage\">\\\\n                <div class=\"nav-menu-divider\"></div>\\\\n                <a href=\"#/pages/create\" target=\"_self\">\\\\n                    <i class=\"ti-angle-right\"></i><span data-i18n=\"Create Page\"></span>\\\\n                </a>\\\\n            </li>\\\\n        </ul>\\\\n</li>\\\\n\\\\nThe element that I\\\\\\'m trying to get hold of is actually one of the ones created with the line:\\\\n<i class=\"ti-angle-right\"></i><span data-i18n=\"{{upage.title}}\"></span>\\\\n\\\\ninside this block. The element itself is not explicitly written, but is created by the Angular ng-repeat function, as an element in a list... Anyone know how I would get hold of a specific element from within this list?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m using Jasmine, FrisbyJS, and Jest to create API tests for my team\\\\\\'s product.  I want to be able to handle when an expect (which I\\\\\\'m pretty sure Frisby is just using the underlying Jasmine expect) fails. I\\\\\\'m not expecting it to fail. I don\\\\\\'t want to use a \"toThrow\", I\\\\\\'m not expecting this call to fail.  I just want better error logging when an expect that I expect to pass, fails. \\\\nI would like the line of the failing expect, an expanded error message including a relevant stack trace, and potentially the ability to write my own error message attached, like \"The call to projects failed\".  Maybe this is a shortcoming with the Frisby module, in which case, how should I handle this from the Jasmine perspective? \\\\nI had this code:\\\\nfrisby.get(environment.ApiUrl + environment.dashboardProjectsApi)\\\\n      .expect(\\\\\\'status\\\\\\', 200)\\\\n      .done(done);\\\\n\\\\nAnd I was receiving this very non-descript error that was lacking any further information:\\\\n FAIL  tests\\\\\\\\dashboard.api.spec.js\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Dashboard API \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xba should return a list of projects this user can access\\\\n\\\\n    AssertionError: HTTP status 200 !== 500\\\\n\\\\n      at FrisbySpec.status (node_modules/frisby/src/frisby/expects.js:25:12)\\\\n      at FrisbySpec._addExpect.e (node_modules/frisby/src/frisby/spec.js:408:23)\\\\n      at then (node_modules/frisby/src/frisby/spec.js:299:26)\\\\n      at _fetch._fetch.then (node_modules/frisby/src/frisby/spec.js:231:18)\\\\n      at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:109:7)\\\\n\\\\n  Dashboard API\\\\n    \\\\xc3\\\\x97 should return a list of projects this user can access (289ms)\\\\n\\\\nI have a couple of issues with this: \\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m getting a stack trace of the expects code in Frisby, not where this code is called in my tests\\\\nI don\\\\\\'t get an expanded message with the error message or stack trace from the API response\\\\n\\\\nAnd then I made this code, which is better and closer to what I would want to log if any of my expects failed:\\\\nfrisby.get(environment.ApiUrl + environment.dashboardProjectsApi)\\\\n      .expect(\\\\\\'status\\\\\\', 200)\\\\n      .then(function (res) {\\\\n          if (res.status != 200) {\\\\n              console.log(res);\\\\n          }\\\\n      })\\\\n      .done(done);\\\\n\\\\nWhich emits a much better message to my console.log:\\\\nconsole.log tests\\\\\\\\dashboard.api.spec.js:19\\\\n    FrisbyResponse {\\\\n      _response: \\\\n       Body {\\\\n         url: \\\\\\'https://mywebsite.net/api/dashboard/projects/get\\\\\\',\\\\n         status: 500,\\\\n         statusText: \\\\\\'Internal Server Error\\\\\\',\\\\n         headers: Headers { _headers: [Object] },\\\\n         ok: false,\\\\n         body: \\\\n          PassThrough {\\\\n            _readableState: [Object],\\\\n            readable: false,\\\\n            domain: null,\\\\n            _events: [Object],\\\\n            _eventsCount: 3,\\\\n            _maxListeners: undefined,\\\\n            _writableState: [Object],\\\\n            writable: false,\\\\n            allowHalfOpen: true,\\\\n            _transformState: [Object] },\\\\n         bodyUsed: true,\\\\n         size: 0,\\\\n         timeout: 5000,\\\\n         _raw: [ <Buffer ... > ],\\\\n         _abort: false,\\\\n         _bytes: 1900 },\\\\n      _body: \\\\n       { message: \\\\\\'An error has occurred.\\\\\\',\\\\n         exceptionMessage: \\\\\\'Sequence contains no matching element\\\\\\',\\\\n         exceptionType: \\\\\\'System.InvalidOperationException\\\\\\',\\\\n         stackTrace: \\\\\\' ...\\\\\\' } }\\\\n\\\\nI have a valid understandable exception message and a stackTrace that I can take back to my developers to further debug.  My issue with this though, has to do a lot of handling to make this raw message into something I want logging (which is maybe what I have to do, but I would think someone would have something helpful out there) and I have to have extra code checking the same status again to verify that \"hey, your call failed\".  I would expect an easier .ifFailed(/do stuff here/) or something. If there is something obvious I missed, I apologize.

The position requires quite a lot of manual testing and a bit of test automation which is going to grow. And, this position is 100% remote (this fact might be critical for this question).\\\\nAside from other activities and topics, we are going to try to pair-test with a candidate during the interview, but let\\\\\\'s assess the situation from a different perspective.\\\\nWhat are the absolute interview \"Don\\\\\\'ts\" for a candidate on a manual tester\\\\\\'s position (with potential automation in mind)? What are some of the red flags we should pay attention to and be aware of?   \\\\nI just wanted to know What is the Meaning of latency in performance testing?\\\\nHow should I create test cases for complex system that provide usage for multiple roles such: super admin, admin, customer service etc.\\\\nThe capabilities such: create, read, delete and update for specific role.\\\\nI might need simpler format to execute both for manual and automated.\\\\nI think about breakdown the test cases into each roles.

The issue is with sending \\\\\\'Guest RSVP Status\\\\\\'. Inconsistently, only portions of the phrase will be sent and cause the rest to error out.

Which is responding slow. Meaning the fetching display late on slow network reception. \\\\nShould I report it or not? I\\\\\\'m a beginner tester in this organization.  \\\\nA little background - We have a native mobile app- Android and iOS, which has a separate chat module. This chat module has text, video and audio cat facility - very much like WhatsApp. \\\\nThe video/audio chat uses WebSocket protocol for communication. We are using TokBox\\\\\\'s OpenTok platform to implement this functionality. \\\\nMy question revolves around testing testing the consistency for this chat module and the OpenTok implementation . By consistency, I mean, I want to measure/check how many times user1 and user2 were not able to connect or how many times user1 successfully called but user2 was not able to connect or was not even able to receive the call.\\\\nI had a detailed discussion and research on this but I\\\\\\'m unable to come to a good tool or a process on how to measure this. Is this something we can do as a part of load testing [which can be done via Jmeter\\\\\\'s WebSocket plugin . ] or is this something that we should check on a network and packet level. \\\\nA google group discussion thread, mentions some KPI\\\\\\'s for a chat server, but are these applicable here? \\\\nOn a unit level, I see that Autobahn\\\\\\'s test suite to be somewhat helpful, but I\\\\\\'m not sure if it can scaled up for an integration or e2e level. \\\\nSometimes, while testing a web application, the app responds much slower than usual. There could be many reasons for this such as bugs in backend, outage in some of the servers, slow internet on client etc.\\\\nHow do I rule out that internet issues on the client are making the web app seem slow ?\\\\nI would like to perform an end-to-end test where I create some data via a UI and then verify it appears in the appropriate report the following day. The challenge is that the report only updates once per day at any point in time between 12AM and 8AM, so in the worst case I need to wait up to 8 hours from the time I create the data before it shows up on the report.\\\\nThe options I see are:\\\\n\\\\nSchedule the test to run just before 12AM and let it run for up to 8 hours polling the report for the data. This is the most straightforward approach but it doesn\\\\\\'t fit in well with our CI framework which is geared towards short jobs. I\\\\\\'ll need to override a couple timeouts just to make this one work, and I\\\\\\'m not totally comfortable with it because it is such a long period of time for a single process to run a test.\\\\nRun the test in two distinct steps. Step 1 completes after the data is created. Step 2 runs at 8AM and verifies the data from Step 1 appeared. This seems reasonable to me but it will now require my test process to manage durable state. I can imagine several ways to achieve this (a durable queue, file, etc) but they all introduce significant complexity. Do I just need to accept that complexity and store state for tests of this sort? What are some best practices or libraries that tend to be used for this?\\\\n\\\\nNeither of these feel ideal to me, but I do not have a lot of experience in testing of this sort. Are there any better approaches?\\\\nPlease help me on this am trying to locate the element using xpath\\\\n\\\\nWhen writing manual test cases, the test case title used to be something like\\\\n\\\\nTC1: Verify that the user is able to login to facebook and react using\\\\n  heart.\\\\n\\\\nWhen trying to automate the scenario using selenium+ TestNG, how to write meaningful test case titles.\\\\nNote: I believe that in TestNG, the test case name is the same as the method identifier under @test annotation \\\\n//Testcase 1\\\\n  @Test\\\\n  public void VerifyThatUserCanLoginToFaceebookAndReactUsingHeart() {\\\\n   //Writeyourcodehere\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nIs it permissible to write such long method names or is there a better way to write test case names in TestNG or/and selenium.\\\\nI am trying to retrieve the content of the header and each chapter which is a repetitive structure as you can see below.

The best part is, no file exists more than one folder down. So you have about 50 folders, each with 300-400 files a piece in them. Luckily, many of the files haven\\\\\\'t been touched in over 7 years, and many of them are deprecated (but we don\\\\\\'t delete them from version control \"just in case.\" Don\\\\\\'t even get me started on that one.) So there\\\\\\'s really only about 1.5 million lines of code we\\\\\\'d actually have to test. \"Only.\"\\\\nI could go on and on about the poor practices of the system. The bottom line was for years, developers had no option to say no. It was \"gimme gimme gimme,\" combined with a lot of contractors moving in and out. Now, they want to clean up their act.\\\\nOne of the first things I suggested was testing. They said, basically \"we\\\\\\'ve been wanting to do testing for years, but we don\\\\\\'t really know where to start.\" The business logic and database access are baked into the UI. (I\\\\\\'d say GUI, but it\\\\\\'s not graphical, it\\\\\\'s on a mainframe. Even the order-entry people telnet in.)\\\\nSo this is pretty much a worst case scenario. Millions of lines of code. Over a billion dollars in annual sales running through the system, so it\\\\\\'s not going to get a re-write (obviously \"it works as it is.\") No object orientation. No formal or automated tests. Our testers are also the ones who write the specs (which biases them toward \"pushing the project through.\")\\\\nI\\\\\\'m getting pretty desperate. I\\\\\\'m even willing to write whatever testing frameworks (there isn\\\\\\'t much for Openedge in open source frameworks) we need on my spare time. I\\\\\\'m convinced it will pay for itself quite quickly. Where can we start? Has anyone here come across a similar project (even if smaller in scale) and if so, how did you cope with and overcome this?\\\\nUpdate: I\\\\\\'ve had a chat with my manager, and I have approval to draw up a spec/timeline for creating a test harness. At first, I heard this: \"What we really need to do is write some tests.\" to which I responded \"Having tests won\\\\\\'t really help us if we don\\\\\\'t have a way to run them. I\\\\\\'ve been looking into ProUnit (the old name for OEUnit) and think it will work for us.\" \"We should write some tests using it.\" It took about 10 minutes of repeating this for him to realize it was not as simple as downloading the library and \"using it.\" But, approval to write a spec to create a test harness is a start! Thanks guys for all your input!\\\\nWhen do you decide to stop testing, for me it boils down to -\\\\n\\\\nAllocated time is exhausted\\\\nNo high severity/priority defects are found\\\\n\\\\nAny other pointers which you consider while deciding to stop testing?\\\\nI use Selenium 2 in C# to automate testing of our web sites. When building non-Ajax functionality, using webDriver.FindElement(By.Id(\"element-id\")) to find elements on a page works fine, but when doing jQuery Ajax calls this doesn\\\\\\'t work because it tries to find the element before the ajax request has finished.\\\\nHow do I tell Selenium to wait until the jQuery Ajax has completed?\\\\nI have a third party check box control in my AUT that QTP does not recognize. Is there a way to have QTP treat it as a regular .NET check box?\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s say you are a developer (specifically, the team lead) and you want to improve the quality of your company\\\\\\'s products.  Since you cannot change the whole company, you focus on what you and your fellow developers can do to enhance the quality of the applications you create/maintain. You decide that this can best be done by embracing TDD for class verification and BDD for integration testing.\\\\nSince we are talking about .NET development here, let\\\\\\'s be specific and use:\\\\n\\\\nMSTEST as a unit testing framework for the TDD\\\\nAs a development house you already use TFS 2010 so the MSTEST solution is a given with its integration of code coverage and test pass validation at check-in.  \\\\nSpecFlow for the BDD\\\\nSpecFlow is more subjective, but I propose it as a BDD tool as it integrates well with VS 2010 and source control, and the gherkin/cucumber syntax is, I think, easier than that of Fitnesse.\\\\n\\\\nMoving from \"coding with ad hoc testing, followed by a release to QA\" to a \"TDD/BDD\" approach will save time and money over the life of an application\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94but, it will extend the time a program spends in development over the ad hoc approach (although arguably the QA time should reduce as QA should then mostly find system test faults rather than those and integration and class bugs devs now find and fix sooner).  \\\\nAssume some minor TDD/BDD projects have already been completed so your company is not overly nervous about the technology, but have yet to \"go for it\" with a full size project. \\\\nBut in this business, development is a different cost centre from QA, and both are different from support and operations.\\\\nSo, how do you sell the benefit to the company of adopting TDD/BDD to development managers who are held to account for the increased cost (i.e., time) of the development department? \\\\nThis, to me, is all the harder given the benefits of failing early, etc. seem largely unquantifiable.\\\\nHow do you go about winning hearts and minds on the topic?\\\\nIn my firm, we don\\\\\\'t have testers, exactly. We have analysts who translate business requirements into specifications. (Think the guy from Office Space, except these guys actually provide some value. Kind of.) Because they have an agenda (keeping the people who gave them the requirements happy) they are often lacking in the thoroughness of the testing they do. Sometimes it\\\\\\'s because they simply hadn\\\\\\'t considered one portion, but sometimes it\\\\\\'s where they actively ignore an area because they know if they test it, it will break, or if they test it they wouldn\\\\\\'t know right or wrong either way.\\\\nThe kicker is, a month from now, I might get a spec that fixes \"a bug introduced with project 12345.\" Well, gosh, I sure did a lot of testing on that, obviously I missed some of it. Now, the development team is the one who takes the flak because they\\\\\\'re the one who introduced the bug. I for one am willing to admit I don\\\\\\'t write perfect code, and so are people on my team. But how do you deal with a (biased) testing group that 1) doesn\\\\\\'t communicate with other testers, and 2) refuses to accept the fact they also missed it in their testing?\\\\nKeep in mind that this is a highly un-idealistic environment. There are some of us who have had it quite good in the past, and would like to bring our department up to speed on best practices. It\\\\\\'s a slow process, and sometimes we\\\\\\'re not sure even where to start.\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve been having to deal with a lot of testing tools lately for testing tasks that should/must be automated.  These include things like performance/load testing, webservice testing, vulnerability scanning, etc.\\\\nAfter experimenting with both the open source and paid types of tools out there, as well as they may work, do not seem to lend themselves to modification to make the work of the individual tester/team easier/make more sense for them.\\\\nDoes anyone have any experience in building any of these tools yourselves in house?  If so, was the pay off worth it?  Many of us are willing to work in our off-work hours in exchange for making our work easier/less of a hassle.  I can see this being of use in some specific circumstances, such as load testing and web service testing as it would be easier to tie into internal resources.\\\\nI am automating web UI tests using Selenium. These tests are written partly in the spirit of Unit tests, that is they try their best to leave the application in the same state in which they found it. For instance, if a test registers a support ticket using the web UI, it is expected to remove it and the end of the test using the web UI.\\\\nCompared to unit tests, these kinds of tests do much more, not in terms of actual code executed or processes triggered, but in terms of tested actions. One such hypothetical test would be:\\\\n\\\\n(Actor 1) register support ticket;\\\\n(Actor 1) comment with initial data;\\\\n(Actor 2) reply with request for more information\\\\n(Actor 1) upload more information\\\\n(Actor 2) comment that issue is fixed\\\\n(Actor 1) close issue\\\\n\\\\nAll of these actions are verified during a test, and should one fail, the application data is inconsistent.\\\\n\\\\nIs there a better way of making end-to-end tests self-contained and idempotent?\\\\n\\\\nTraditionally, structured test, especially long scenarios are commonly written in the step, expected, actual format.\\\\nBehaviour Driven Design replaces this with the style of \"Given\", \"When\" \"Then\",  for example\\\\nGiven a working ATM\\\\nAnd invalid credit card\\\\nWhen the card is inserted\\\\nAnd a cash withdrawl is requested\\\\nThen no cash should be provided\\\\nAnd the card should be retained\\\\nI want to start use BDD on complex scenarios on a project, and the question that I have is: Does this new style of test case work for larger, real world, end-to-end scenarios or is it more appropriate for simpler \"atomic\" or unit test style test cases?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m completely new to this stuff, and for what I\\\\\\'ve seen it takes a while to get used to it.\\\\nI once tried, but felt I was spending way too much time just writing the tests, or just fixing them \\\\\\'cause a big requirement changed.\\\\nSo what are the advantages?\\\\nWe are using a rich client developed with Flex. We would like to build automated tests to test whole features. I saw a module for Selenium, Flex Monkium, which could do the job.\\\\nDid you try it out? Is it worth it? Do you know another solution?\\\\nIs there a difference between \"testing\" and \"quality assurance\"?  If so, what are the main goals of each process?  What are the critical differences?\\\\nHow do you use screen shot capture in selenium tests? If anyone is using, how effective do you find it ?\\\\nHow do you estimate a testing project? What are the things to be take care of while estimating the time for a testing project ?\\\\nIn my team, there are a number of experienced QA people. I work mostly on developing tools to make the QA process easier for these guys, such as developing test automation.\\\\nThe uptake has been slow, maybe due to the fact that these guys are stuck in their ways, and don\\\\\\'t really understand how test automation can help, and make their jobs easier. \\\\nI\\\\\\'ve tried presentations/demo\\\\\\'s etc. to get my point across, all to no avail. I\\\\\\'ve even spent time automating almost the entire QA process for a simple application, only for the QA lead to use outsourced QA testers to test it!!\\\\nThere\\\\\\'s buy-in from management, but no mandate to say that automation has to be used.\\\\nHas anyone ever faced a similar situation? Don\\\\\\'t get me wrong, these guys do a very good job, but I\\\\\\'m beginning to think that I\\\\\\'m wasting my time in this company (a large multi-national), and that my time would be best spent looking for another job.\\\\nWe have a TFS 2010 project (MSF Agile v5.0 template) project, the SSRS reports for burndown allow us to specify start and end dates for the current iteration, but the project portals excel charts parts for burndown do not seem to have that option anywhere I can find it.\\\\n\\\\nCan anyone explain how I can configure the portal\\\\\\'s excel burndown chart to have the begin and end dates I want rather than the defaults?\\\\nThis isn\\\\\\'t really a question for me anymore, but, out of curiousity and to help a former co-worker.\\\\nBefore moving to Quality Assurance, I led a UAT team.  This team was made up of former users, who didn\\\\\\'t actually use the systems that they were testing anymore, except for when they were testing it.  This seems odd to me, and I always got push back from the Business on engaging actual users.  Is this common?\\\\nOn to my real question though, how often should UAT be utilized.  Currently, within my organization, UAT is only utilized when changes are made to SOX (Sarbanes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93Oxley) impacting applications, and SOX impacting changes made to other applications.  Although I\\\\\\'d like to involve UAT more often, I receive push back from the business.  I\\\\\\'d like to start using them for any changes that impact a customer or end user.  What is considered normal for involving User Acceptance Testing?\\\\nI have heard that, when using Selenium, the CSS Locator has better performance than the XPath Locator. \\\\nWhich Locator do you use in your tests? \\\\nHave you seen a great performance improvement when using CSS Locators? \\\\nWere there times when you had to use XPath instead of the corresponding CSS Locator?\\\\nI have largely worked with Selenium for front end automation. Looks like there is great market for QTP in this arena, especially when you could afford commercial tools. \\\\n\\\\nHave you worked with both QTP and Selenium? How have your experiences been with both? Do you find any one better over other?\\\\n\\\\nI have been running into intermittent errors with some java selenium-rc tests which I think are related to a page which has an ajax poll and automatically refreshes when some condition is reached on the server. In this scenario, I have no way of asking selenium to wait for the page to load, and so I run into a bunch of random \"Couldn\\\\\\'t access document.body\" errors.\\\\n\\\\nSo, is there some way I can cause selenium to gracefully handle this situation? If not, is there some way I could detect whether the user is selenium from the page\\\\\\'s javascript, and disable the automatic refresh?\\\\n\\\\nIf it helps at all, the javascript code in the page looks something like...\\\\nvar ajax = new Ajax(url, { \\\\n    update: state,\\\\n    method: \\\\\\'get\\\\\\',\\\\n    onComplete: function(message) {\\\\n        if (some_condition) {\\\\n            window.location.replace(unescape(window.location));\\\\n        }\\\\n    }\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\nI am running single purpose performance tests on a daily basis.  Currently, I run each test 3 times and average them out.  But I get fluctuations from day to day which make it difficult to detect whether or not this is due to a code change.\\\\nWhat is a statistically appropriate way to measure and calculate performance?\\\\nHow would you use BDD to describe complex interactions with a state machine?\\\\nFor example consider this scenario:\\\\n\\\\nUser enters input into the system.\\\\nThe system transitions into state A.\\\\nThe user enters more input into the system.\\\\nThe system transitions into state B.\\\\nThe user enters some more input into the system.\\\\nThe system transitions into state C.\\\\nVerify that the system is indeed in state C.\\\\n\\\\nIs this a single scenario?\\\\nDo you describe steps 1 and 3 as Given, step 5 as When and step 7 as Then?\\\\nWhat happens if steps 2 or 4 fail?\\\\nAfter feeding the search bar with \"Safety\" keyword, I am trying to get to the page associated with this link_text.

How to do that? Can we open that in Eclipse and do updates/Edits on JAR File script?\\\\nI have a situation whereby, say, I have one API which creates an employee(POST); one which then returns the employee(GET) and one which deletes the employee(DELETE).\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve been using RestSharp/C# to create my API tests which I\\\\\\'ve found really useful, however I\\\\\\'m struggling to understand how I\\\\\\'d create a test like the above where I\\\\\\'d want to test multiple API\\\\\\'s as part of the one test so that I can ensure the creation and deletion works as expected. For example, I\\\\\\'d pass the Name as a parameter from the \"create employee\" API and ensure it is returned in the GET request.\\\\nIf anyone has any advice or working examples of this, it would be very useful\\\\nSo here\\\\\\'s the setup, we have tests where we fetch test data from excel sheet and iterate over all the rows within a particular test. So, for example, there are tests that create some user profiles, once they do; there\\\\\\'s a success message that appears on the next page, our test uses the \"findElement..\" method to capture that element and get\\\\\\'s the text to verify that 1) it appears and 2) that the message is correct. Now here\\\\\\'s the problem, since the test may iterate over and over a lot (because of excel data rows), every so often we notice that the test throws NoSuchElementException while looking for that success message. I was recently told by someone that instantiating that page object class at each iteration would solve this issue. So my main question really is that would instantiating the page object class solve this, or is there something else I\\\\\\'m missing? Following is a sample of the code (not exact code of course)\\\\n    SuccessPage successPage = new SuccessPage(driver);\\\\n    InputPage inputPage = new InputPage(driver);\\\\n    String successMessage = \"\";\\\\n    excelSheetData = someCustomMethodThatFetchesDataFromExcel();\\\\n    for (Map<String, String> rows : excelsheetData){\\\\n      inputPage.inputElement1.sendKeys(rows.get(\"columnName1\"));\\\\n      inputPage.inputElement2.sendKeys(rows.get(\"columnName2\"));\\\\n      inputPage.buttonElement.click();\\\\n      wait.until(ExpectedConditions(visibilityOf(successPage.successEle)));\\\\n      successMessage = successPage.successEle.getText();\\\\n      Assert.assertEquals(expectedSuccessMessage, successMessage);\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\nPage object file look something like this\\\\n    public class SuccessPage {\\\\n    WebDriver driver;\\\\n       public SuccessPage(WebDriver driver){\\\\n          this.driver = driver;\\\\n       }\\\\n    @FindBy(\"someLogicalName\")\\\\n    public WebElement someElement;\\\\n\\\\nSo roughly about 8 out of 10 times the above code works correctly, but those two other times it throws that NoSuchElementException at successMessage = successEle.getText();\\\\nWhat I\\\\\\'ve been told I should do instead is something like the following\\\\n    SuccessPage successPage;\\\\n    for(....\\\\n      ...\\\\n      //create a wrapper clickSubmitBtn() method that returns the page object.\\\\n      successPage = inputPage.clickSubmitBtn(driver); //this will instantiate the page object.\\\\n      successMessage = successpage.successEle.getText();\\\\n      ... }\\\\n\\\\nSo,\\\\n\\\\nwill this really solve the problem?\\\\nis that a good programming practice, should instantiation be done\\\\nonce before the loop?\\\\n\\\\nWhen I am trying to run the below mentioned Selenium web driver code in IE 11 browser,  I get below error:\\\\n    Exception in thread \"main\" org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to find element with css selector == #text\\\\\\\\-input\\\\\\\\-what\\\\n\\\\nCode:\\\\n       package com.indeed.tests;\\\\n       import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;\\\\n       import org.openqa.selenium.By;\\\\n       import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\\\\n       import org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver;\\\\n\\\\n    public class IndeedJobSearch {\\\\n\\\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\\\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\\\\n    // Call the IE server to invoke IE browser\\\\n        System.setProperty(\"webdriver.ie.driver\",\"C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\paulso\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Desktop\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Testing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Automation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Selenium Automation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\IEDriverServer_Win32_3.14.0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\IEDriverServer.exe\");  \\\\n     // Create Internet explorer driver to driver the browser\\\\n        WebDriver driver= new InternetExplorerDriver();\\\\n     // Maximize the window server.\\\\n        driver.manage().window().maximize();\\\\n     // Open Indeed home page\\\\n        driver.get(\"https://www.indeed.co.uk/\");\\\\n        driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS);\\\\n     // Find What field and enter Selenium\\\\n        driver.findElement(By.id(\"text-input-what\")).sendKeys(\"Selenium\");\\\\n        }\\\\n       }\\\\n\\\\nError (Console log):\\\\n    Started InternetExplorerDriver server (32-bit)\\\\n    3.14.0.0\\\\n    Listening on port 8609\\\\n    Only local connections are allowed\\\\n    Sep 20, 2018 11:31:15 AM org.openqa.selenium.remote.ProtocolHandshake createSession\\\\n    INFO: Detected dialect: W3C\\\\n    Exception in thread \"main\" org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to find element with css selector == #text\\\\\\\\-input\\\\\\\\-what\\\\n    For documentation on this error, please visit: http://seleniumhq.org/exceptions/no_such_element.html\\\\n\\\\nI am using Selenium with Cucumber to automate one web application, But I am stuck at one element which is not working out with the XPaths and link text \\\\nI also applied the implicit and Explicit wait, \\\\nhover mouse functionality using actions driver also \\\\nthere are no iframes involved either\\\\nBut nothing seems to work out.\\\\nCan someone help me with this??\\\\nThis is the web element I need to click and the HTML\\\\nI tried following XPaths: Upon validating on console them point to the web element but on when I using it in the script it throws the exception.\\\\n //a[contains(text(),\\\\\\'Logout\\\\\\')\\\\n\\\\n//div[@class=\\\\\\'pull-right\\\\\\']/a\\\\n\\\\n//*[@class=\\\\\\'logout_class curPnt\\\\\\']\\\\n\\\\nAlso attaching my code snippet \\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m diving into the world of API testing and coupled with that integration testing.

For example on the front end we might click a button that is used to create a new widget which sends the request to the back end which creates the widget and returns a response containing the new widget.\\\\nIn the above scenario we would create our initial unit tests by mocking the actual network requests and just specifying the data that we want sent / received. Everything passes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6great.\\\\nThen we change something on the backend and will change the backend unit tests accordingly. Once again all our unit tests pass. But the problem is that now our front end tests continue passing even though the back end has changed.\\\\nThis continually makes me question the value of unit testing and reminds me of this:\\\\n\\\\nHow should integration testing be done with decoupled front / back ends?

of the coverage.py maintainer on the Talk Python to Me podcast show.\\\\ncoverage.py has a new feature to track what and how many tests called a specific line in the code. A potential suggested use case for this feature is to look for the lines in the code that have been executed \"thousands\" of times during a test run indicating that these lines were over-tested and there is a potential to cut down on the number of tests - with a motivation to make a test run faster.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m a bit confused as I cannot imagine myself deleting tests because of the over-covering specific lines in the application code. Are there any other potential problems of over-testing?\\\\nI am trying to run a java file from selenium using cmd. Just adding libraries means that the java command (in command lines) does not work (javac works, the file is compiled). Does anyone know any hint?\\\\npackage folder;\\\\n\\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.By;\\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;\\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver;\\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select;\\\\npublic class fileJava{\\\\n  public static void main(String[] args){\\\\n    System.out.print(\"Hello World\");\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI am developing a testing framework for an application at my work and am running in to an issue. I use Selenium 3.0.1, NUnit 3.5.0, NUnit3TestAdapter 3.6.0, and a Selenium Grid instance to run my tests. In order to parallellize my tests properly I instantiate my webdriver instance at the start of each test (in the test itself, not in a setup method). I do this so that if multiple tests try to execute at the same time they are not trying to talk to the same static webdriver. \\\\nI am running in to an issue that when an Assert.IsTrue fails the Driver.Close() method (a wrapper for my driver instance close routine which executes the .Close() method on its own) directly after it does not execute because my code never makes it this far. I understand that this is because the the failing assertion causes the compiler to exit code execution and return a failing test. \\\\nMy issue with this is that when my Driver.Close() method does not close sessions end up hanging on my grid nodes making them unable to effectively execute the next test in line. If I were using a static driver that I could simply pass around I would just execute the Driver.Close() routine in a teardown method however as I am instantiating my drivers at the start of each test this is not possible. \\\\nDoes anyone have a way that given the constraints of my environment I can still kill the browser session on my grid node after an assertion fails on a test (perhaps some arcane way that I am unaware of to pass my instantiated RemoteDriver to a teardown method at the end of each test)?\\\\nMy code is shown below for clarity:\\\\nAn example of a test:\\\\n[Test]\\\\n\\\\npublic void GoToSearchPage()\\\\n{\\\\n    // Create an instance of the RemoteDriver object\\\\n    RemoteDriver remoteDriver = new RemoteDriver(\"firefox\", \"WINDOWS\", \"Hub_Location\");\\\\n\\\\n    // Go to the search page\\\\n    SearchPage.GoTo(remoteDriver);\\\\n\\\\n    // Verify that the browser is at the search page\\\\n    Assert.IsTrue(SearchPage.IsAt(remoteDriver), \"The web browser is not at the default search page\");\\\\n\\\\n    // Close the session\\\\n    remoteDriver.Close();\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nAn example of my driver.Close method that lives inside the RemoteDriver class:\\\\npublic void Close()\\\\n{\\\\n    // Close the currently open browser and dispose of the currently open instance\\\\n    Instance.Close();\\\\n    Instance.Dispose();\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nEdit\\\\nBelow is the code implementation of the answer provided by ernie\\\\npublic void GoToSearchPage()\\\\n{\\\\n    // Create an instance of the RemoteDriver object\\\\n    RemoteDriver remoteDriver = new RemoteDriver(\"chrome\", \"WINDOWS\", \"HUB_LOCATION\");\\\\n\\\\n    // Go to the search page\\\\n    SearchPage.GoTo(remoteDriver);\\\\n    try\\\\n    {\\\\n        // Verify that the browser is at the search page\\\\n        Assert.IsTrue(SearchPage.IsAt(remoteDriver), \"The web browser is not at the default search page\");\\\\n    }\\\\n    catch(AssertionException)\\\\n    {\\\\n        // Close the currently open browser session\\\\n        remoteDriver.Close();\\\\n\\\\n        //Fail the test\\\\n        Assert.Fail(\"The web browser is not at the default search page\");\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    // Close the currently open browser session\\\\n    remoteDriver.Close();\\\\n\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nWhile this solution does introduce some slowness (approximately 2-3 seconds if the catch is activated) this allows me to avoid refactoring the way I implement my driver in order to use a setup or teardown method.\\\\nI am automating a webpage using Selenium but there is one scenario where after clicking on a button, it opens up an Excel sheet. I need to enter a value in the cell of the Excel sheet. I am using Sikuli (in Eclipse) to do that but the header name of the cell is not unique. (Please refer the screenshot)\\\\n\\\\nI am trying to enter the value in the cell highlighted in red box.\\\\nI tried the below code (in Eclipse) but it is clicking the wrong cell.\\\\nScreen s = new Screen();    \\\\nPattern p = new Pattern(\"images/Cell.png\");\\\\ns.find(p);\\\\ns.click(p);\\\\n\\\\nCell.png is as below:\\\\n\\\\nI have a php code to check using sonarqube.

I need to learn siteprism using capybara. When I was going through the documentation of siteprism i can\\\\\\'t relate section with page objects.\\\\nI have implemented annotations and pagefactory. But i cannot relate sections in siteprism with anything in selenium. \\\\nI have a problem when trying to find many elements in a page. Basically i have 20 identical pages, with slightly different data. Think 20 excel sheets. Page 1 50rows, page 2 100 rows, etc.. each row contains link and some data, and i want to find and make a list of all those links. So i go to page 1, get all links, move on to page 2, page 3, then when im at page which contains lots of rows, it (test) freezes, page stays open forever and there are no errors.\\\\nIm pretty sure problem is with FindElements() since this method i use to get links from each sheet/page and it works for ones with fewer elements:\\\\n        List<IWebElement> _links = new List<IWebElement>();\\\\n\\\\n        List<string> links = new List<string>();\\\\n\\\\n        links = d.FindElements(By.PartialLinkText(partialLink)).ToList();\\\\n\\\\n        int i = 0;\\\\n\\\\n        foreach (IWebElement element in _links)\\\\n        {           \\\\n            links.Add(_sellerLinks[i].Get_Attribute(\"href\"));\\\\n            i++;\\\\n        }\\\\n\\\\nIt works flawlessly when there are 10-40 rows, sometimes fail at 70 rows, and can never get past \\\\\\'sheet\\\\\\' with 400 rows. If there was problem with code it would fail sooner i think.\\\\nWhat is the limit to FindElements ?

I cannot imagine to have a whole build green, if all tests are skipped.\\\\nIs there a way to mark a build as unstable if at least one test is skipped?\\\\nHow do you use the bugs that you find while testing to get more attention to refactoring and improving the overall code base and re-writing particularly troublesome sections of code that have been proven as buggy, hard-to-maintain or poorly written?\\\\nI would like to store the \"FHCS79\" out of \"Your booking number is FHCS79\" in a variable. \\\\nstoreText css=h2 string<br>\\\\necho ${string}\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the smoothest way?\\\\nCurrently am using selenium-java-2.53.0,can you tell me which is the most stable FF version for it.\\\\nThe website I\\\\\\'m testing has been built with Visual Studio C#.

I\\\\\\'ve just realized that I don\\\\\\'t understand how to create an association between a test run and a version of our software. I thought that I could use the \"Name\" of the test run to capture this detail, but that seems weak. TestLodge does support custom fields and I could create a \"Software Version\" field, but the fact I need to create a custom field makes me think I\\\\\\'m approaching this wrong.\\\\nUpdate: I misunderstood the custom fields as they apply to Test Runs; it will add a field to each Test Case in the run, but not a field to the Test Run \"container\" itself.\\\\nIs there a common approach or best practice to associate a test run with a software version? Do you use the name? Do you create a new Test Plan for each version?\\\\nI have to capture image using webcam and save as profile image.\\\\nBelow is the screenshot of my flash application\\\\n.\\\\nBelow are the steps I have to perform:\\\\n\\\\nClick on allow\\\\nclick on capture\\\\nclick on save\\\\n\\\\nI am trying to automate a minimal form interface using Selenium to capture an element & later Java code.\\\\nBut the challenge is the minimal form has only one input container which is constantly changing and the input container generates dynamic id\\\\\\'s so finding the element by id name is not possible.\\\\nThe input container cannot be mapped with xpath because xpath also uses the id \\\\neg. //md-select[@id=\\\\\\'select_15\\\\\\'].\\\\nwe have a module in our architecture which checks a SFTP(server)directory for new transmitted XML files, validates them against XSD and if successful it takes the XML file from the directory and does something with it.\\\\nMy question is now: What is a good/the best way to tests this module automically.

Now the situation is changed. E.g. many important firms do not extend their CMMI certifications and smaller firms drop their ISO 9001 certification. What software quality assurance frameworks and methodologies are being used today?\\\\nThe Agile method is pervasive and it seems to me that all is based on experience and conventions on individual teams.\\\\nMaybe there is available some report or review about the current situation.

But the maintenance is a pain, because each time a feature gets changed, that is present in more products, we have to update several files. However, even some of the core features of the product, which are completely same for 9 customers are behaving differently for another.\\\\nWhat I think, we are missing, is some central document, which would describe all features together and from which we would then generate the test execution plan.\\\\nBut I am not sure how to structure such a document, how to describe the \"common features\" and \"custom specials\" so these are maintainable.\\\\nIs there anyone who has used something similar or solved similar problems?\\\\nI am trying to test the performance of a Silverlight application using JMeter. can you please tell me is that possible? If it is possible, can you please provide me the detailed steps to be followed.\\\\nThank you.\\\\nI am new to both Automation and selenium. I am planning to write an automated tests for the UI using selenium web drivers in the py.test. I would like to know what is the best architecture (not the code) for designing the whole automation. The structure I am considering is \\\\nFramework level - contains modules for getting the page object, and functions like getItem, logout, login,logging, exceptions, startbrowser, getClickableObject, sendkeysandenter, generate report, waitforresponse, getting and releasing testbeds, loading the webdriver, Global test properties connections or any other generic functions etc\\\\nTests - get the page object, get the item by id, click,sendkeys,verify etc. Basically I want developing the tests to be as simple as possible and anyone can get aboard and write the tests without needing to know the details of implemenation.\\\\nIs this a good way for long term maintenance and ease of writing? Any other suggestions are welcome.\\\\nAdditionally, two more questions.\\\\n\\\\nDo I have to store all the pages (something like page map) statically somewhere to verify the pages are loaded correctly. For example, an enter loads a particular page. My main concern with this way is what if the resultant page change? Does the corresponding test cases have to rewritten again?\\\\nAny action in the UI sends a command to a particular device and changes it properties. The device has a Rest API which returns its properties and this can be used if the changes in the UI is reflected on the device.  Ideally, it would be better if this comparison is made for every test. If this might cause too much overhead, this can be made optional.

I would like learn JavaScript and JQuery parallely, which can be used in automation scripting. \\\\nI would like to know which automation tool is more powerful in JavaScript and JQuery? \\\\nAlso, I would like to know which tool is more in demand on market today?\\\\nWe\\\\\\'re working on test code (mainly UI tests with a few different tools). One thing that\\\\\\'s really stumping me is how to best separate test data from test scripts. By test data, I mean values that get input into the AUT. \\\\nCurrently, I have a bunch of classes that simply contain test data in methods. This almost works but it\\\\\\'s \\\\n\\\\nnot scalable and \\\\nnot modifiable from outside the test code. \\\\n\\\\nWe\\\\\\'ve discussed some approaches like keeping data in a test data database, where different data are called when needed by scripts. This is likely the way to go, but I have no idea how to implement it. What are some approaches that others have had success with? I\\\\\\'d like to have test scripts as agnostic to incoming data as possible.\\\\nEDIT Some more details about these tests: All test data are parameters that are passed from an external source (different classes, xml, database, etc) into the test code. These tests are written in Java.\\\\nThis is my first time here but I have already posted this question on SO. I keep getting solutions for Windows + Java and not for Linux or python for that matter.\\\\nI am using Selenium and Python to automate a file upload application for the past many hours but nothing helpful! \\\\nThe HTML DOM structure for this file upload is an input tag with its type attribute value = \\\\\\'file\\\\\\'. I know I can make use of the send_keys. \\\\nThe problem is I am not supposed to use send_keys() (as per the question I am trying to solve). The assumption is there are other ways of doing it.\\\\nCan anyone suggest me alternative ways to upload the file? I do get solutions for windows but not for Linux(Ubuntu). I know there are applications/tools to automate GUI components like AutoIt but there is nothing for Linux close to AutoIt.\\\\nI can say I have done my homework to find a solution. Only after not finding anything useful, I am asking this question, please help! \\\\nAfter two days of continuous trial, I thought it\\\\\\'s better to ask you folks here. I want to upload a file on my desktop to a remote server. For this I am making use of python and its module requests. I get good help from the internet but even then when I execute my piece of code, I am not able to upload it.\\\\nSo here is the code I have written:\\\\nimport unittest\\\\nfrom Browser import Browser\\\\nfrom selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException\\\\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\\\\nimport requests\\\\n\\\\nclass Upload(unittest.TestCase):\\\\n    def setUp(self):\\\\n        print \"Setting up before test case execution...\"\\\\n        self.driver = Browser().initialiseBrowser()\\\\n        self.driver.maximize_window()\\\\n\\\\n    def test_Upload(self):\\\\n        self.driver.get(\"http://www.justcloud.com\")\\\\n        self.driver.find_element_by_link_text(\"Login\").click()\\\\n        self.driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\"input[name=\\\\\\'email\\\\\\'][id=\\\\\\'login-email\\\\\\']\").send_keys(\"test_usrname\")\\\\n        self.driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\"input[name=\\\\\\'password\\\\\\'][id=\\\\\\'login-password\\\\\\']\").send_keys(\"test_pswd\")\\\\n        self.driver.find_element_by_xpath(\"//input[@value=\\\\\\'Login\\\\\\' and @id=\\\\\\'login-submit\\\\\\']\").click()\\\\n\\\\n        wait = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 20)\\\\n        wait.until(lambda driver: self.driver.title.startswith(\\\\\\'Just Cloud\\\\\\'))\\\\n\\\\n        try:\\\\n            self.driver.find_element_by_xpath(\"//div[@id=\\\\\\'not-installed-container\\\\\\']//span[text()=\\\\\\'X\\\\\\']\").click()\\\\n        except NoSuchElementException:\\\\n            print \"HURDLE dialog did not appear\"\\\\n\\\\n        url = \"https://upload.backupgrid.net/add\"\\\\n        fileToUpload = {\\\\\\'file\\\\\\':open(\\\\\\'/home/pinku/Desktop/Test_Upload.odt\\\\\\', \\\\\\'rb\\\\\\')}\\\\n        print fileToUpload \\\\n        s = requests.Session()\\\\n        s.auth = (\\\\\\'test_usrname\\\\\\', \\\\\\'test_pswd\\\\\\')\\\\n        response = s.post(url, files=fileToUpload)\\\\n        print response.text\\\\n\\\\n    def tearDown(self):\\\\n        driver.close()\\\\n\\\\nPlease help me point out the mistake I might have made in the code above.\\\\n2 days back I had absolutely no clue of the approach to upload a file. I am sure I am very near to this solution. So I request you guys to help me get it. Trust me, I have put a lot of effort to get this done. \\\\nI recently came across a Google Tech Talk during which the speakers seemed to stress that trust in a test suite is crucial to the overall software development process. Here the link.\\\\nCan anyone share their opinion on this? If you agree that trust in a test suite is important, what do you do in your team to build that trust? I thought of asking the devs to sit down & basically code review whatever tests I wrote for the features they originally wrote. However, I\\\\\\'m not sure if that\\\\\\'s the best way.\\\\nThanks. \\\\nI have been writing Selenium Browser automated tests and now I would like to begin writing mobile browser automated tests for Android and IPhone.  I am deciding between the Appium framework and the Selenium AndroidDriver and IPhoneDriver.  Does anyone have experience in these frameworks and knows which framework is easier to jump into from Selenium Browser automation?  Also which framework looks to be the most active, supported, and likely to be a good choice for the future development?\\\\nI have a web application which i would like to automate the testing for functional as well as load testing.\\\\nHowever , it has the following features which i feel will hinder the most common automation tools from functioning.\\\\n\\\\nThe web application throws a SSL client authentication prompt in the login page after clicking on Submit button where i need to choose the appropriate certificate for the user to login.\\\\nIn form pages , once again , the form data is signed using an ActiveX control or a firefox addon , which will throw a prompt similar to the SSL client authentication prompt from which the user selects his key to sign the data beofre submitting to the server.\\\\n\\\\nIs it possible to automate the user activity in this application from user login , few page traversals, a form submission with the signing and logout . How can this be done ?[Tools etc].\\\\nIf this is possible , then will i be able to scale this activity to say 100 users at the same time ?\\\\nI know there is an action class where this is possible, but I just understand common keys, such as: enter, backspace, and tab. For instance:\\\\naction.sendKeys (Keys.ENTER).perform();\\\\n\\\\nFor modifier keys---Caps Lock, Control, Option, Command---it is not very clear how to use sendKeys?\\\\nI need to generate a report from the dashboard view of Quality Center to get all the blocking defects in my test sets. Meaning, I want to filter the list of defects that are linked to test instances marked with the status \\\\\\'blocked.\\\\nCould you please help me in generating such custom report?\\\\nThanks,\\\\nKarim.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m testing a library that processes queries based on User-Agent.  In my tests, I\\\\\\'d like to feed it as much strings as possible.\\\\nWhere can I find a public collection of User-Agent strings?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m mainly interested in \"real\" strings, but a collection of specifically interesting strings could be of use (like examples that are likely to put stress on parsers).  Plain newline-delimited list is OK.\\\\nI bought Binder\\\\\\'s \"Testing Object-Oriented Systems\" book.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m a technical QA, and wanted to both strengthen my test automation skills and become more thorough. However, I found the book so abstract and difficult to understand, that I cannot make any practical use of it. I though it might be my opinion only but I found there are more similar views of experienced software engineers, so maybe there are objective hurdles to read and \"apply\" this book.\\\\n\\\\nHow do you read this book?\\\\nWhat problems have you solved thanks to this book? \\\\n\\\\nThere are people here who read this book and recommended it, so I believe the book can be useful in practice. I just need to hear how.\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve read a lot of technical literature, research papers, documentation so I was expecting this book will be both useful and legible to me. I am used to literature and research papers that are problem-driven. Books that follow a bottom-up approach, where a reader can build his or her own model of solving certain class of problems, by reading about those problems. This particular book does the opposite, so if someone can show me connection between real problems and the theory laid in this book, I might learn or motivate myself to grab for this book again.\\\\nI have a bunch of unittests written in python in which messages (text) of any kind is used. Instead of \\\\\\'hardcoding\\\\\\' the text examples used for the tests I would like to use a database of some kind (simple text file, pickle file) which contains such test examples, and which can be extended either manually or automatically very easily. \\\\nIs there a dedicated framework/module available, or do I do this simply on my own and create a simple text file? Maybe there are some best practices available I can follow?\\\\nWe are building an application, which is based on Qt 4.8 on Windows. I have been looking for an automation tool which is cross-platform and should be able to automate my application. I have read a few papers about Linux Desktop Testing Project (LDTP), so I am interested to know whether tool can be of any help to me?\\\\nOur team is responsible for web application testing. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve recently faced a question of providing the most common (and what is more important, the most convenient and handy) format of displaying data in a detailed test report: pdf, email, html, excel, word, etc.\\\\nWe would appreciate your sharing your experience and practice of representing detailed test results.\\\\nI am new to testing. I need to learn because I have an opportunity to work in this field in the the future. I would like to know what I need to get started. Preferably, I would like to study automated testing. How much time will it take for someone who only knows a little programming and no testing?\\\\nTools, tutorials, courses (free or YouTube), all information is welcome. In the beginning, I only need to learn the basics, not be an expert.\\\\nI was applying for QA position and the SDET asked me this question: \\\\nHow do you test a backend API? \\\\nIn the interview. \\\\nI wasn\\\\\\'t sure I answered it correctly. Just wondering if I can get some input from someone.\\\\nIn the past I\\\\\\'ve used BDD - Cucumber with the Gherkin syntax - for UAT (User Acceptance Testing).  Is this the main area of testing for using Cucumber ?\\\\nMy organization also has the following areas of testing:\\\\n\\\\nunit\\\\nintegration\\\\nsystem integration\\\\nregression\\\\n\\\\nIs it suitable / practical to use BDD for these other areas, or is it only suitable for User Acceptance Testing ?\\\\nI have karma tests that during execution runs PhantomJS.\\\\nUnfortunately, when some of those tests fail, error messages are not very helpful. Thus, I would like to debug them.\\\\nHowever, most sources that I\\\\\\'ve found suggest creating a separate configuration for debugging - configuration using Chrome (or another modern browser) to debug tests. For example:\\\\nhttps://wannabeegeek.com/2017/04/07/debugging-jasmine-unit-tests-running-with-karma-runner-in-vs-code/\\\\nhttp://blog.mlewandowski.com/Debugging-Karma-tests-with-VSCode.html\\\\nIs it possible to run those tests in debug mode, step-by-step, using breakpoints without changing PhantomJS to Chrome?\\\\nWhen I have dependencies such as http or authenticate, how can I use Cucumber without being slowed down on these services ?\\\\nI am reading a book Testing Object oriented systems, and found the following:\\\\n\\\\nIf a boundary condition uses two or more variables, then on and off\\\\n  points can be found by solving the related equations. Generally, if\\\\n  there are k independent variables (on the right side), there are k\\\\n  on points.\\\\n\\\\nSo I wonder, what do they mean?

Can you advice which tools can be used to develop Model Based Test in C#. Is it normal to use NModel? Or it\\\\\\'s obsolet? What tools is used now?\\\\nI work with a business team where no one has been a developer or has studied software engineering. I have been working on their Android App as a QA for the past few months, and I have realized that they have been focusing and judging my performance not on the basis of how much I work and find bugs, but suddenly I am questioned when there is an issue detected by anyone from the business team.\\\\nI have been telling them that 100% tested and bug free product is a myth. But their answer to this fact is \"Change your mentality to expect bugs\". Of course this is not in a tester mind while testing a product, but this is fact.\\\\nNow I feel that they have made up their mind that my mentality is not correct. \\\\nHow can I work with this group without being judged on an impossible standard?\\\\nI have recently started developing an automated test suite for one of my company\\\\\\'s products, which has been written in AngularJS, using Protractor as the testing framework (although I have used JavaScript quite a lot in the past, I am new to AngularJS, and have never previously worked on anything that has involved automated testing).\\\\nHaving decided to design & write the tests in as \\\\\\'modular\\\\\\' a way as possible, i.e. grouping the tests that are testing similar features/ related elements of the application together, I have started with writing some simple scripts to test the app navigation.\\\\nWhile this has started well, and all of my tests for the first few navigation buttons & pages pass correctly, I ran into an issue when testing the navigation to one particular page: the \\\\\\'Charts\\\\\\' page.\\\\nThe issue that I ran into here, is that as soon as the user browses to this page, there is a service running within the app that automatically opens up a dialog to give the user options for creating/ editing a chart. Because this dialog \\\\\\'overlays\\\\\\'/ sits on top of the actual page, all of the menu buttons are disabled while the dialog is open, so my test script currently fails, as it can\\\\\\'t find the menu button to return to the page that it navigated from.\\\\nTo solve this, I want to add a few lines to my test script, that will find the dialog\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'Cancel\\\\\\' button, & click it, before continuing with the rest of the script, but due to how the dialog service has been written, the \\\\\\'Cancel\\\\\\' button (& other elements belonging to the dialog) don\\\\\\'t have id attributes that I would usually use to get hold of them (i.e. doing something like var dialogCancelBtn = element(by.id(\\\\\\'cancelBtn\\\\\\'));).\\\\nThere is a DialogMgr service written within the application, which has a closeAll() function that would be useful to call in order to close the dialog, so that the test can continue to run. \\\\nThe DialogMgr has been defined with:\\\\nangular.module(\\\\\\'app.dlg\\\\\\')\\\\n// The service provides dialog windows based on the bootstrap Modal service\\\\n.factory(\\\\\\'DialogMgr\\\\\\', function ($rootScope, $document, dialogs) {\\\\n\\\\n// A list of active instances of dialogs\\\\nvar dlgs = [];\\\\n\\\\n// Variable to store the loading dialogue\\\\nvar loadingDlg;\\\\n\\\\n...\\\\n    // Function to dismiss and remove the dialog from the manager\\\\n    function closeDlg(dlg) {\\\\n        // If the dialog is defined\\\\n        if (angular.isDefined(dlg)) {\\\\n            // Fetch the index from the dialogues\\\\n            var index = dlgs.indexOf(dlg);\\\\n\\\\n            // Remove the dialogues\\\\n            dlgs.splice(index, 1);\\\\n\\\\n            // Dismiss the dialogue\\\\n            dlg.dismiss();\\\\n        }\\\\n    }\\\\n    ...\\\\n    return dialog_manager;\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\nWhat I\\\\\\'m not sure about is how I \\\\\\'get hold\\\\\\' of this service from within Protractor. The service is obviously not an HTML element, so I can\\\\\\'t do something like dialogService = element(by.id(...));... \\\\nHow would I get hold of the service in order to use its functions within my test script?\\\\nEdit\\\\nThe HTML for the dialog appears to have been written so that it can be used for a number of different dialogs, and not just for this form:\\\\n<div class=\"modal-header dialog-header-confirm\">\\\\n    ...\\\\n</div>\\\\n<div ng-form=\"chartConfigForm\" class=\"ui-tab-container ui-tab-vertical\">\\\\n    ...\\\\n</div>\\\\n<div class=\"modal-footer\">\\\\n    ...\\\\n    <button class=\"btn btn-default\"\\\\n            type=\"button\"\\\\n            ng-click=\"cancel()\">\\\\n        <span data-i18n=\"Cancel\" class=\"hidden-xs\"></span>\\\\n        <span class=\"ti-na hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg\"></span>\\\\n    </button>\\\\n    <button class=\"btn btn-default\"\\\\n            type=\"button\"\\\\n            ng-disabled=\"tabIdx.type === \\\\\\'tabs\\\\\\' && tabIdx.idx === 0\"\\\\n            ng-click=\"back()\">\\\\n        <span data-i18n=\"Back\" class=\"hidden-xs\"></span>\\\\n        <span class=\"ti-angle-left hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg\"></span>\\\\n    </button>\\\\n    <button class=\"btn btn-default\"\\\\n            type=\"button\"\\\\n            ng-disabled=\"isLastTab()\"\\\\n            ng-click=\"next()\">\\\\n        <span data-i18n=\"Next\" class=\"hidden-xs\"></span>\\\\n        <span class=\"ti-angle-right hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg\"></span>\\\\n    </button>\\\\n    <button class=\"btn btn-brand\"\\\\n            type=\"submit\"\\\\n            ng-click=\"draw()\">\\\\n        <span data-i18n=\"Draw\" class=\"hidden-xs\"></span>\\\\n        <span class=\"ti-bar-chart hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg\"></span>\\\\n    </button>\\\\n</div>\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m looking for recommendations on test automation framework for running a suite of command line applications.  \\\\nI\\\\\\'m used to more development unit testing type of frameworks such as xUnit or MSTest based tools. \\\\nI\\\\\\'m looking for something targeted more towards a compiled executable types, rather than require access to the programs and classes. \\\\nI would like something that has a common setup/tear-down mechanism (depending on the application, we may need need to construct a queue with the queue manager) and will have common reporting feature to other tools such as Jenkins.  \\\\nWe\\\\\\'ve used cTest but I find that a bit lacking for the setup.  I\\\\\\'ve started looking at shUnit2 but I\\\\\\'m curious what else may be available.  \\\\nThe target is Linux system.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m very much interested in taking ISTQB Software Testing Foundation course.\\\\nBut before I start with the course I wish to familiarize myself with Software Quality Assurance & Testing. \\\\nSo are there any online sites that might help me with the syllabus also with mock exams?\\\\nPlease send links !!!\\\\nIn the ISTQB syllabi I found this statement:\\\\n\\\\n\"Note that test automation refines the fundamental test process by\\\\n  inserting test generation between test design and test\\\\n  implementation.\"\\\\n\\\\nCan anyone clarify the role of test generation step?\\\\nSince we say that IDs are faster and are preferred over XPaths, how different would the execution of the following be?\\\\n\\\\ndriver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//button[@id=\\\\\\'Save\\\\\\']\")).click();\\\\ndriver.findElement(By.id(\"Save\")).click();\\\\n\\\\nI need to write automated tests for jQuery based plugins using Selenium WebDriver and Mocha. I have 3 questions.\\\\n1.mocha test command is used to start the test. If I need to do the tests parallelly in all the browsers, how would I achieve it? By looping through the test suites using different browser plugins or is there a better way to achieve this?\\\\n2. My Test cases mostly involve checking with the attributes and content of the DOMElement. Can\\\\\\'t I use selenium web driver just to open the browser and deal every other with plain javascript instead of using Selenium API to get the element, and do some actions on the button like performing Click Operation? Mocha allows this when it is run in the browser.\\\\n3. In which case, should I use build tools like Grunt or Gulp for my test cases? Kindly explain this with an example.  \\\\nI\\\\\\'m currently working on a website which takes 2-3 MINS to complete the page load. Even after all the elements are visible,still browser keeps loading. I have figured it out that happens because the website contains social media links such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram etc. Facebook access is prohibited in where I am right now. SO browser took so long to complete the connection between those buttons and social media servers. I blocked Facebook from host file even but no luck yet. Is there a way to stop running scripts or stop making connections with those servers from those buttons.? \\\\nPS: I\\\\\\'m not the developer of the website. So cannot change anything on the code. I checked with chrome,Firefox and even with IE drivers. - no luck.\\\\nSo im in a bit of a conundrum. I have a Rails project which i\\\\\\'ve written Automated tests for in Capybara using ChromeDriver/Selenium. It works great, but is quite long.\\\\nI also have headless chrome driver \"set up\" for this project....but honestly it just doesn\\\\\\'t work great. Headless chrome driver is a bit early and has gone through a lot of changes but will probably inevitably be the \"go-to\" headless driver of choice probably taking over PhantomJS.\\\\nThis being said, i\\\\\\'d typically use poltergeist to run headless because it works well...but at the same time phantomjs will probably eventually lose out to headless chrome, and not to mention a lot of the issues we\\\\\\'ve seen with this particular app have been browser related.\\\\nSo that being said: Is it crazy to run a browser based UI Automation on a CI Server? Obviously it will be slower but def. more accurate. Is this common practice? I\\\\\\'ve only been doing automation for a little over a year but not a whole lot via CI.\\\\nThanks!\\\\nI am generating an extent report every time my regression suite runs. The project folder structure is ProjectFolder/Results. I am running the regression suite from Jenkins job.

Your help/suggestions are very helpful to me\\\\n\\\\nNOTE: I am facing this issue only PhanjomJS browser only in remaining all browsers are working fine\\\\n\\\\nIt seems that model based testing approach is dead. Most of tools for model based test end in 2010-2012. For example NModel is dead, Spec Expoler ends in 2012 visual studio. Why? What new methods are currently developing for testing?\\\\nI was asked in an interview this question\\\\nThat two different scenario requires data from a common sheet. How to we identify that data already used , while passing it as input. \\\\nIn general how to identify the data is already used and we need to select another record from data sheet.\\\\nMy Problem:\\\\nI am in a situation where there is no immediate demand to test any feature (no new features in need of testing, or no new changes made)\\\\nThis makes it difficult to identify areas that are potentially highly buggy, but there are no clear signs of that (such as recent constant crashing, customers sending tickets, or failing tests).\\\\nMy question:\\\\nHow do I prioritize areas of the product under test for adding tests (KPI, rules of thumb, general regression sweeps) in the absence of new feature development? Or am I overthinking it, and maybe other tasks (such as automation/process improvement) should be higher priority?\\\\nI often get requests from developers and others to test some scenarios to check if a web app functions correctly. Generally, these scenarios don\\\\\\'t have enough details and I have to waste a lot of time in getting information that should have already been given to me. So, I was thinking of forcing the entire organization to communicate such scenarios in Gherkin format, as shown below.\\\\nGIVEN the conditions condition-1, condition-2, condition-3 etc.,\\\\nWHEN these actions action-1, action-2, action-3 etc. are performed,\\\\nTHEN these events occur event-1, event-2, event-3 etc.\\\\n\\\\nThis format seems very helpful in that it will make scenarios clear and reduce the need for unnecessary communication to find out the GIVEN, WHENS and THENS that one needs to know before they test something.\\\\nBut, since I have limited experience in using Gherkin, I am not sure if Gherkin is the best way to communicate scenarios in all kinds of situations. I don\\\\\\'t know if there are any better methods out there. So, what is the best way to write testing scenarios ?\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve seen several mentions of an issue when running tests in Firefox: the Flash player doesn\\\\\\'t load the SWF if the browser window doesn\\\\\\'t have focus. This causes sporadic test failures if the system used for running tests is doing anything else. I\\\\\\'ve verified that if the Firefox browser is behind IE the test will hang until it times out or else I bring Firefox to the foreground manually.\\\\nA workaround that allows the Selenium2/WebDriver test to bring the browser to the front or to override this behavior of the player would be much appreciated. \\\\nIn my experience, Business Analysts (BA\\\\\\'s) are commonly used to perform \"happy path\" testing when an application is developed.\\\\nShould the reverse also be true with testers being (more) involved and performing static testing of requirements before they are handed to developers instead ?\\\\nSome background.  I am a long time WatiN coder, and have been since I first looked at Selenium a few versions ago, and decided that it didn\\\\\\'t meet my needs, and then went with WatiN.\\\\nI now want to switch to selenium 2 (selenium web-driver).\\\\nWhat are the best resources? Where can I can find out about getting started with Selenium 2?\\\\nI am personally interested in the C# API, how control mapping works, and implementation examples. Selenium HQ.org still talks primarily about Selenium IDE and the older versions.\\\\nI can see why the community can sort of look down on the ISEB exams (at least the Foundation - I haven\\\\\\'t looked at the material for any of the others). So I got to wondering exactly what similar courses are out there that could genuinely help you become a better tester? I\\\\\\'ve heard of the Weekend Sessions but don\\\\\\'t think im quite ready for that level yet.\\\\nI haven\\\\\\'t experienced a transition from waterfall to Agile myself - I worked for companies using Prince2, waterfall approaches to managing projects, and then I got a job working for a company using Agile. But for most traditional testers, their first exposure to Agile will be when their company decides to adopt it.\\\\nWhat resources are there for testers in a company transitioning to using an Agile approach? What problems do they tend to face, and how do they overcome those problems?\\\\nCan anyone recommend any good security testing resources?  Although I have a basic security skillset, I\\\\\\'d like to improve this.  Some of the training I\\\\\\'ve seen online however seems kind of sketchy.  Resources would have to be a reasonable price.\\\\n\\\\nI know that there\\\\\\'s no one answer for this, but still, hoping for some recommendations.\\\\n\\\\nI was wondering if there are any repositories or wikis of formal testing techniques - test design ideas, like pairwise or boundary. I couldn\\\\\\'t find one so far. \\\\nThanks!\\\\nAhmet\\\\nI have a test matrix for my product\\\\\\'s installation, which is n-dimensional, where n is about 11 or 12 at this point. For instance, the OS is one dimension, and the DB is another, and the Reporting engine is a third etc.\\\\nIn this matrix, every intersection of these parameters is a separate test that needs to be run and reported. \\\\nHow can I display these results so that they can be easily reviewed to see which tests have been run/passed/failed?\\\\nOne of the things that I miss about WatiN is the ability to attach to browser instances that were not spawned by Selenium.  In my last position, this was the whole reason why I used WatiN, as the browser was always spawned by another application.\\\\nI was hoping that I would be able to do this through .getWindowHandle() and then .SwitchTo().Window(string), but this doesn\\\\\\'t seem as though it\\\\\\'s the case.\\\\n\\\\nThe ability to do this is invaluable when it comes to writing and debuging scripts and do hope that I\\\\\\'m either doing something wrong, or that it\\\\\\'s on the roadmap.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s say you have product or project that is coming near to a next release and that has previous versions released a while ago and that has a big suite of automated user acceptance tests that just take too long to run, from one day to two. \\\\nHow often do you run these?\\\\nHow do you handle bugs (failing tests) in such a large suite of tests?\\\\nHow to maintain automation framework for  different browsers like IE and FF?\\\\nIn my current set up, I maintain two different configuration properties files, one with xpath locators that FF supports and one with DOM values mostly for IE.\\\\nWhat I tried to do is switch between the Properties files so as to support the respective browsers when running , Is there a better way?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m looking for a good Mockito tutorial. I found some things, but either they are incomplete (which means: if you need something a bit more complicated than the basics, forget it), or they are badly explained.\\\\nDo you know some tutorials well written and covering at least all the major topics of the library?\\\\nHas anybody worked on testing Cassandra DB which is a NOSQL distributed DB?\\\\nWhat are the important things to be taken into account while doing this?\\\\nI have heard as well as followed concept of keeping UI objects in external filed (xml or properties files in java). But there are times when I need to keep the objects with in test because I use them dynamically.\\\\nFor example consider one html table with div having uniquq id. The div could have n number of links. I need to read their innertext. So I would be doing -\\\\nfor(int i=0; i<=CSSCount(div[id=\\\\\\'unique\\\\\\']>a);i++) {\\\\n    print(selenium.getText(css=div[id=\\\\\\'unique\\\\\\']>a:nth-child(i)))\\\\n\\\\n}\\\\nSo I have app object available in test class it self, that is - css=div[id=\\\\\\'unique\\\\\\']>li:nth-child(i) as I need to iterate through its elements. Is it possible to externalize such app objects also?\\\\nI have seen some SQA groups use defect arrival or \"discovery\" rates in order to determine whether a piece of software is ready to be released.  The idea is that the rate at which defects are uncovered will slow to an acceptable level.\\\\nWhat are these techniques?  How is an \"acceptable\" defect arrival rate determined?\\\\nEdit: Daniel\\\\\\'s answer gives a nice list of items.  To elaborate on the question: what are the methodologies that allow setting of appropriate rates of decline / discovery of defects?\\\\nEdit 2: This link shows an example of the methodology.  Has anyone used this or something like it?\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve tried my best to keep this question non-subjective so am not asking which blogs are definitively \"the BEST\" but instead am using the opportunity to just try to broaden my scope of reading around the subject.\\\\n\\\\nI am already reading blogs by Michael Bolton, James Bach, Alan Richardson, Dorothy Graham, the Google Testing blog (James Whittaker) and the Weekend Testing blog. \\\\n\\\\nCan anyone make some further recommendations?\\\\n\\\\nI have a Junior QA interview coming up, and I was asked to learn the basics of Selenium. I have done this through free tutorials. I am fine with the Selenium concepts, but I was told I would be asked how I would test real-world objects at a conceptual level. I may be asked to test any random object in the world but it will probably be a simple one - bicycle, can opener, etc. I will not have to write code but explain it orally. I am not sure how to approach studying for this and how I should relate it to Selenium testing with Java. I can\\\\\\'t find any resources that are similar to this, so I am asking here to be pointed in the right direction, or for a conceptual example for a real-world object.\\\\nThe person in HR didn\\\\\\'t really give me much info other than that I would be asked to explain how I would test real world objects without writing any code.\\\\nFor example, let\\\\\\'s say I\\\\\\'m asked how I would test a bicycle. The way I would answer this now not knowing what they\\\\\\'re really looking for is this:\\\\nI would ask what the function of the bicycle is and how the various parts work together to achieve this functionality. I would deduce that the bicycle has 3 primary functions; be driven by a drive train through the rotation of the peddles by the user, and a braking mechanism operated by the user, and the swivel of the front wheel to turn.\\\\nNow that I have determined the primary functionality I would break these down into smaller problems to test. For the sake of this post, I will just go into the drive train. I would determine when the user pedals it will turn the chaining which it would pull the chain forward. This chain is connected to a chaining on the rear wheel which turns the wheel through the transfer of energy given from the chain. I would then ask is this the only way the user can use the bicycle? Is pedaling the only function that the client has access to? If, so I would test to make sure this function properly catches any invalid input or uses.\\\\nI would need to test each individual piece so as to build a larger test. I  would check to see how the Pedal class calls the Chaining class. How do they interact? What would happen if I passed the argument \"pedal_backwards\" to the chaining? What kind of constraints with pedaling does the Chaining enforce? Next, I would check to see how the Chaining calls the Chain class. What constraints are there in this invocation? I would do the same for the rear chaining.\\\\nBasically I would break the object down into smaller problems and test how they interact with each other. This way changes to the code base will still be testable with my tests and will continue to work autonomously.\\\\nAm I on the right track? I wasn\\\\\\'t really given much information just that an engineer would pick a real-world object and ask me to test it.\\\\nThanks\\\\nOnce i reset the password through selenium script the confirmation overlay page just remains for 2 sec which i`s not captured by selenium to inspect.

When running on Firefox, there is a noticeable lagging and the shapes are more jerky / choppy.\\\\n\\\\nBefore asking the actual question, let me describe the current situation.\\\\nThe IT department consists of a few Scrum-like teams, with one or two software testers per team.\\\\nFurthermore there are two overarching roles not bound to a team: the QA team lead, and a test automation expert.\\\\nThe test automation expert has achieved the following in about 18 months:\\\\n\\\\nCreate a framework to write API tests\\\\nCreate a framework to write UI tests\\\\nCreate a framework to set up data (using SQL and events) for automated tests\\\\nCreate a tool to collect and store results from all test runs\\\\nOver 2500 API tests have been written (including by the other testers)\\\\nOver 120 UI tests have been written\\\\n\\\\nAdditional notes:\\\\n\\\\nTraining of the team members is ongoing (basic coding skills to writing automated tests).\\\\nTests are integrated in CI pipelines by the team lead and architectural team.\\\\nMaintenance of API tests is a responsibility being pushed to the teams.\\\\n\\\\nConsidering the above, the current \\\\\\'test automation\\\\\\' work is now limited to:\\\\n\\\\nmaintenance of frameworks and tests (but that\\\\\\'s decreasing)\\\\ntraining/coaching (limited in time of course)\\\\nwriting additional API/UI tests on new features for the teams\\\\n\\\\nThe question\\\\nIs there a next level of challenges for this role - beyond the frameworks? And beyond simply adding more tests? In what other ways can the role support the QA process?\\\\nOne idea was exploring AI test automation but that is quite a different beast. Especially because the ROI - for in-house tools - seems hard to defend.\\\\nAdditional edit\\\\n\\\\nThe tests are run in pipelines (each team has at least one pipeline, and there are pipelines for consolidated Dev/Release branches). Especially for releases, tests provide a quick feedback and are fairly consistently at about 98,5% passing rate.\\\\nTest data management: currently, some pipelines deploy to both a \"manual testing environment\" having a full restored database, and and \"automated testing environment\" having an empty database. This database is first of all prefilled with fixed core data (specific scripts). Furthermore every test is self-sufficient in that it prepares its own customers, contracts etc.\\\\n\\\\nHere is my HTML code,\\\\n    <div class=\"input-group-btn search-panel dropdown open\">\\\\n    <input type=\"search\" id=\"footerSearch\" class=\"form-control search-input search-filter-component\" name=\"x\" placeholder=\"Search term...\">\\\\n    <span class=\"input-group-btn gosearch-btn\">\\\\n            <button class=\"btn  search-filter-component\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-search\"></span></button>\\\\n        </span>\\\\n\\\\nI am getting below error, Exception in thread \"main\"\\\\n    org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException:\\\\n    Element info: {Using=xpath, value=//span[@class=\\\\\\'input-group-btn gosearch-btn\\\\\\']}\\\\n        at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\\\\n        at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(Unknown Source)\\\\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(Unknown Source)\\\\n        at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Unknown Source)\\\\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.ErrorHandler.createThrowable(ErrorHandler.java:216)\\\\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.ErrorHandler.throwIfResponseFailed(ErrorHandler.java:168)\\\\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver.execute(RemoteWebDriver.java:635)\\\\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver.findElement(RemoteWebDriver.java:368)\\\\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver.findElementByXPath(RemoteWebDriver.java:473)\\\\n        at org.openqa.selenium.By$ByXPath.findElement(By.java:361)\\\\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver.findElement(RemoteWebDriver.java:360)\\\\n        at PncSite.EnterSite.main(EnterSite.java:35)\\\\n\\\\nThanks for your update.

Is there a way to save the state of the system once a step passes? So, therefore, running the test above and it failing on the last step, means that if I run it again it will restore the state of the system based on a snapshot of how it was after the last step and continue to run from the next step.

I feel this is  redundant because that data is already being pulled by the application and is displayed correctly (or incorrectly) in the application.

Am I missing something?\\\\nThanks for your input.\\\\nMore info: To me, it seems that the only practical purpose for verifying a database directly (for our circumstances) would be to verify that any data replication is successful. We have web and console based apps that use separate DBMSs. The two we use are SQL Server and DB2. After specific data is added to SQL Server, a job runs that replicates it to DB2. They have different structures, so the tables / fields are all different between the two. I can understand verifying this replication has performed successfully.\\\\nThe Selenium IDE browser extension is great for quick and easy automated tests.

During 2 years of development we haven\\\\\\'t had real load tests. Now release is getting close and QA is responsible for preparing and executing load tests. We (dev team) have suggested, that the load tests should be prepared and executed ASAP, before UAT starts and re-executed at least once before release. \\\\nOur proposal has been refused by Joe. The reason was that code is still changing and every code change could possibly break test scripts and require them to be updated. Joe explained that load tests should happen after code freeze, preferably after everything is already approved by the business. It was also refused by head of QA for the same reasons.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m not really into testing, so - is this really the way to go? Is it common practice to load test just before the release?

How do you QA otherwise? \\\\nAny pointers on what people in the field are doing would be great.\\\\nRemark/Edit 2011-11-27:\\\\nAt this stage the question is sort of open ended (could be a community wiki like on stackoverflow). I presented a 4 hour workshop about testing at AnDevCon 2 and found out about some new development and available tools as well. \\\\nI\\\\\\'ve been looking at calculating the ROI on automated test on a project that I\\\\\\'ve been working on. However, I\\\\\\'m a little stuck when it comes to determining a good method for this. Simply counting the defects found when executed on the continuous integration sever doesn\\\\\\'t really help as many developers run the test locally before checking in code, so I can accurately count how many defect have been found. So my question is how would I calculate this? My gut feeling is that they have massively helped, but I need to quantify this!\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve worked in a variety of environments with differing ratios of QA / SDET personnel vs. developers focused on building and maintaining application features.\\\\n\\\\nIs there such a thing as a \"right\" ratio?  My suspicion is that things vary a lot, but what factors should be considered for the number of staff?\\\\n\\\\nSo I use xpath locators and slowly converting to CSS.\\\\nI haven\\\\\\'t found a way to do an exact match based on text.\\\\nFor example converting //a[text()=\\\\\\'Log Out\\\\\\'].\\\\nI know you can do css=a:contains(\\\\\\'Log Out\\\\\\') but I want to match exactly to the text. Also I know I can do link=Log Out but looking for a solution with CSS.  \\\\nI understand and practice most normal testing methodologies, however for systems with several distinct interacting processes testing obviously becomes a lot harder. Unit testing is often not possible, or preventively difficult. \\\\nI am interested in the tools, techniques, and idea\\\\\\'s for automated testing of large distributed systems.\\\\n\\\\nI have found the following video presentation from a google engineer about some of their testing techniques. Do know of any other similar presentations?\\\\nWhat comes to mind is Make, or build.xml, but I have not found a comprehensive Orchestration tool for python testing yet.\\\\nAny suggestions?\\\\nSo right now to run my Selenium 1 tests I use a custom Firefox Profile that sets when I launch my Selenium Server.\\\\nIs there a way to properly set this profile to run in Selenium 2? I\\\\\\'ve tried setting the FF profile using new FirefoxProfile(\"path\"); however that doesnt seem to work. What it DOES to is delete everything in that path folder(weird, I know). Can I use the Selenium Server to tell Selenium 2 what to use? Or does this just not work in Selenium 2b3 yet? \\\\nAs I understand it, this sentence means that automated tests don\\\\\\'t find new bugs in existing code (though they might catch a new bug in new code that breaks old code).  Is this correct?  Or is this piece of wisdom actually claiming that regression tests rarely catch regressions in practice?\\\\nAlso, is this statement wrong for automated exploratory testing (e.g., fuzzing, randomized inputs to data-driven tests) that can end up running specific tests that were never run before and finding unexpected exceptions, hangs, or program crashes that indicate bugs?  Would it be more accurate to say that automated checking will not find new bugs in old code?  Or am I still missing the point of this statement?\\\\n\\\\nThis seems like a commonly cited piece of tester wisdom, so I really feel like I need to understand both what the statement is getting at, and any exceptions to its correctness.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m trying to find a way to test the interactions of our platform with external servers, like Twitter, for example.\\\\nOn our online photo sharing application, we have, for example features which let the user publish a content on his/her Twitter feed. The code relies on Twitter4J.\\\\nHow can we write an automated test to check if a tweet was really sent to the feed, publishing photos on Facebook etc.\\\\nThe difficulty is: I can hardly modify the API in order to make my specific test, and of course, I have no influence on the external system.\\\\nI am developing a asp.net mvc site that depends deeply on a 3rd party web service.\\\\nI would like to know what is the best approach to develop this site since the web service is not ready yet and I can\\\\\\'t wait it to be ready to start developing.\\\\nI am using Specflow and selenium to drive my development.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m quite interested in the Scipy/Numpy project which is basically a Python scientific computation/numerical methods library. I\\\\\\'m also interested in testing. What are some good approaches for testing such a library, or any software library? There already are extensive unit tests, which run pretty well. But what would an acceptance test look like? Thoughts? \\\\nI\\\\\\'ve worked for companies that have little documentation for their applications, and most of it is probably comments in code. \\\\nHow is a person, who is placed in the quality assurance department, suppose to verify that an application is doing what was intended to do; if there are no requirements documents and they are just told to \"play around\" or \"read the user manual\"?\\\\nIn a similar vein to the question blogs to follow to further learning, I would like to ask if there are any noteworthy testing podcasts? Searching in iTunes domes up pretty empty on the topic.\\\\nI know there are heaps of development ones, are there any good testing podcasts?\\\\nNote: This would be community wiki, but the feature on questions appears to have been removed.\\\\nSince it is not possible to acquire all s/w and h/w under the sun, we often resort to using virtual machine, user agent, multiple IE etc.\\\\nI have had instance when I did not find an application functioning on a virtual machine especially multiple IE but when approached another colleague having the desired configuration, it worked well.\\\\nGiven such instance I began to doubt using such simulation for testing. Do you also test using such simulation than actual device.

This test involves the below mentioned scenario:-\\\\n\\\\nLogin to application\\\\nNavigate to the Search Page\\\\nOpen Create New Page\\\\nEnter Data and Save record (at this point an entry is created in Database too)\\\\n\\\\nI have added Validation Rule (Finding Username, which is displayed on page header once record save operation is completes) in this test, just to make sure that record is saved and web test is working fine, all the test data (like Name, Address etc.) is coming from CSV file. Now, when I run this test it executes well and assertion (Find Username) works fine. Entry is there in Database too.\\\\nNow, I have created a load test in VSTS Ultimate which is using this web test and specified the user load as 5 with constant load pattern and Iteration count as 1, this test case still creates only 1 entry in Database while I have 5 rows with different dataset in CSV file. But if I increase the number of Iterations from 1 to 5, then it creates 5 records; which is a bit confusing. Why VSTS Ultimate is not creating 5 records with constant load as 5, why it is creating only 1 record for 5 user load.\\\\nFirst I thought that application might not be able to handle 2 concurrent user load but if that had been the case then I should get Assertion Failed error or some other error which is not there.\\\\nWhat could be the possible reason for this behavior of load pattern?

Thanks for your watching.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m using Selenium in C#.\\\\nWe have several Angular applications (Micro UIs) and they are all 100% covered by our UATs (User Acceptance Tests) written with Protractor (Angular Test Framework based on Selenium).\\\\nThere are several problems with this approach, although this is probably the best and suggested way for Angular Testing:\\\\n\\\\nTime consuming... Do not understand me wrong. These tests are super handy, whenever we make a change, we let these run (these are actually integrated in our CI/CD Pipelines) and be sure that the app works still as we want. But still, even if we test a use case at least 1 time manually anyway, this has to be also written in Protractor/Jasmine. And takes time..\\\\nThese Tests are very dependant on HTML Structure. Some locators find the html elements with xpaths (very bad), some with id etc. but at the end, any change in HTML, would somehow cause a change in our tests.. although the change does not change anything on UI for the end user.\\\\nThe whole CSS is ignored. Like the typical Selenium Tests, all tests run against the DOM, and except tests which checks the hidden/shown fields, over 90% of our CSS is ignored.. if one day, a single line which never supposed to be shown in 2 lines shown, really is shown in 2 lines, we will not know that automatically.\\\\n\\\\nI imagine a test framework like this: you open your app on browser, and start the keyboard/mouse capture tool of your test framework. Then you start testing a scenario on your app in your browser, for example you move your mouse on a specific location, you click on a button, you choose a value from a dropdown, a redirect occurs, and at the end you look on your screen and see if the desired X text is shown on the right side.\\\\nThe only thing which the capture tool cannot know is what you really checked (X text on the right side). For this you take a screenshot of this area, and put in your test framework.\\\\nThese mouse/keyboard captures will then be replayed while testing on the Pipeline and the checks/asserts are done against these screenshots.. even with some pixel offset maybe, if you do not want your tests fail in case of tiny css changes.\\\\nWould it be usefull at all? Do you know some frameworks like this? Specially which we may use for our Angular apps? Do you think this approch is better regarding time and quality?\\\\nThe benefits would be:\\\\n\\\\nSince you just let your capturing tool run while you are manually testing your app just after you finish your implementation, and make some screenshots and put them in framework somehow, tests would not consume so much time like writing code for UATs.\\\\nThey would mostly run independent of HTML Structure. So as long as our button is located on its location and on its behaviour, it would not bother us if it now has a one more div parent in the DOM.\\\\nOur Css would also be tested since we compare pictures.\\\\n\\\\nAnd at the end, this is just what we want, to look on the app and see if it looks right, click and enter some keyboard events and check again if we see what we want. Not like protractor or selenium tests, which just blindly communicate with the DOM.\\\\nShort description\\\\nMy current test scenario is about designing a test staging environment that is addressed via an API gateway. We chose WSO2. They already have corresponding test frameworks on board, but I want to go other ways, because we already use acceptance testing via Cucumber and serenity. \\\\nAnother problem is that several projects are currently being tested in regression. Of course I have to take a look at these projects to change them to the current and agile way.\\\\nIn my planning I want to do acceptance tests, UI tests and penetration tests in the test environment (but also in the production environment).\\\\nFor the acceptance test, we currently used serenity in the test environments and, of course, integrated reporting accordingly. \\\\nFor penetration testing I would use ZAP or a similar tool and want to integrate it into the test environment as well as into the production environment.\\\\nCurrent structure:\\\\n\\\\nVarious projects with applications that are still being tested via\\\\nregression on the one hand.\\\\nIsolated projects tested through serenity and pipelined into\\\\nJenkins  \\\\nCurrently no penetration test available\\\\nCurrently no load or performance test available\\\\nThe test team is currently designed for three testers\\\\n\\\\nPlanned structure\\\\n\\\\nAPI Gateway Solution via WSO2\\\\nPlanned integration of serenity Jenkins pipelines into WSO2 as\\\\nacceptance test on test environment\\\\nPlanned load and performance test on the production environment\\\\n(possibly already on the staging environment?)\\\\nPlanned penetration test on the test environment as well as on the production environment\\\\n\\\\nqueries\\\\n\\\\nWould you rather use your own test frameworks in WSO2? Or should existing test frameworks be connected to WSO2 via Jenkins? \\\\nShould integration testing be performed on the staging environment?\\\\nWhat would your test plan look like on an appropriate staging\\\\nenvironment?\\\\nShould Load and Performance Testing only be performed on the\\\\nproduction environment?\\\\nShould one use the existing penetration test solutions of WSO2 or\\\\nrather integrate own solutions?\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m running into an issue with getting the traffic from a WCF-based Windows desktop client to show up in the JMeter recorder - and I\\\\\\'m hoping someone out there might be able to point me in the right direction.  \\\\nComplicating things a bit, I\\\\\\'m not working directly with the developers of the system, but rather for one of their customers - which somewhat limits my access to some of the information and expertise I would otherwise expect to have.  The client runs over WCF with a binding to an HTTPS endpoint on Azure.\\\\nI have JMeter running on the same box as the client.  I have the JMeter Proxy Server working and the ApacheJMeterTemporaryRootCA.crt in place and working.  The client doesn\\\\\\'t have it\\\\\\'s own proxy settings, but does appear to be honoring useDefaultWebProxy=\"true\" (as indicated by the client failing with SSL security warnings when the temp cert isn\\\\\\'t in place).  However, when I exercise the client with the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder running, none of the traffic to and from the client ever shows up in the recorder.  When I use a browser under the same setup, the traffic is getting recorded as expected.\\\\nBeing able to get the recorder working is vital because I don\\\\\\'t have access to enough information about the client\\\\\\'s protocols to try building out tests for them manually (and I suspect it may prove outside of my skillset, given my very limited experience with WCF).\\\\nAny useful solutions, suggestions, tips, or pointers would be GREATLY appreciated!\\\\n(I\\\\\\'m posting this question in XXXXX to maximize my chances of getting the right answer quickly.  If this type of cross-posting is frowned upon, I apologize for any inconvenience.)\\\\nBest,\\\\nJustin\\\\n\"If you can\\\\\\'t tell me what you tested, you might as well have not tested.\"\\\\nMy colleague and I have been given the task of Piloting Test Automation in our company. \\\\nWe need help deciding on the Action Plan. \\\\nSome Actions we noted are as below :\\\\n\\\\nDesign an Architecture of \"Test Automation\" that would include defining proper naming convention, maintaining source code, maintaining version history and control\\\\nSelecting Stable Application for Test Automation.

Here are few approaches that I can think of-\\\\n\\\\nVery Simple and straight approach where the testing team uses the same code repo on which dev is working, And we add the API test cases just like the unit test case in Test package of the same repo.\\\\nPROS: less work because the testing team need not create DTOs etc., test cases will be available to the dev team, \\\\nCONS: every time we add new test cases, we will have to do a pull request to merge the test cases, test cases will require immediate attention in case of dev code change otherwise there would be compilation failure.\\\\nUsing a separate project with the third-party library, for example, REST ASSURED to automate the APIs testing. Here the testing team will import the dev code and use the DTOs, database access objects from the imported dev code.\\\\nPROS: less work because the testing team need not create DTOs etc.\\\\nCONS: test cases will require immediate attention in case of dev code change otherwise test cases will give compilation failure.\\\\nDo not use Dev code at all and write all DTOs and everything and automate the test cases using REST Assured in a separate project.\\\\nPROS: Not any dependency on DEV code.\\\\nCONS: The testing team will have to create lots of DTOs for mapping the request and response JSON. This will take too much efforts and time and will be a replication of task which is already done by the dev team.\\\\nDo not create DTOs and use JSON Schema to create DTOs at runtime and use REST ASSURED in a separate project.\\\\nPROS: No need to create too many DTOs.Test case management and maintenance would be easy.\\\\nCONS: Not found yet, please suggest what cons could be of this approach.\\\\nOr Any other approach which is better than the above approaches.

I refer SoapUI own documentation resource for testing. But their is not discussed all features step by step properly. And not also discussed for advanced web service testing.\\\\nPlease say some good resource  for web service testing with SoapUI not SoapUI pro.\\\\nN.T- I will be thankful if anyone post his own web service testing process video tutorial with SoapUI not SoapUi pro.\\\\nRecently we found a concurrency problem in our Web app. It came out that  a class in a third-party library is not thread-safe and when it is shared between multiple threads, then access to it must be somehow synchronized. This finding was a by-product of load testing of our Web application with many concurrent users.\\\\nI wonder if for finding concurrency issues I should run more focused tests in addition to load tests? Or maybe it is enough to run traditional performance tests? Or maybe I should change something in performance tests so they detect such issues better? E.g., \\\\n\\\\nmake test scenarios more complex, including more endpoints in one scenario.\\\\nrun threads with random delays to increase the chance of interesting interleavings between accessing the shared resource.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m using webdriver.Firefox and I\\\\\\'m trying to send the following custom header:\\\\nself.headers = { \\\\\\'Authorization\\\\\\': \\\\\\'Basic %s\\\\\\' % b64encode(bytes(self.args.user + \\\\\\':\\\\\\' + self.args.password, \"utf-8\")).decode(\"ascii\") }\\\\n\\\\nin the following way:\\\\nself.driver.get(self.base_url + \"/\", headers=self.headers)\\\\n\\\\nwhich is similar way as shown here, but I\\\\\\'m guessing it\\\\\\'s using completely different driver.\\\\nHowever I\\\\\\'ve the error:\\\\nTypeError: get() got an unexpected keyword argument \\\\\\'headers\\\\\\'\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve checked the old issue #2047: How to add a header to a request?, but it\\\\\\'s closed as duplicate of another Won\\\\\\'t Fix issue.\\\\nIs there any way of simply test the site using Selenium which is behind Basic Authentication?\\\\nOne suggestion is to use proxy, however I don\\\\\\'t believe such simple functionality doesn\\\\\\'t exist.\\\\nAny suggestions?\\\\nShould we do negative test cases testing by automation. Generally I heard that we can do functional and regression automation. I am doing same. I am using selenium web driver for automation and doing all functional and regression testing using it. But thing is all tests are positive here.\\\\nSo I would like to know that should we do automation for negative testing or it is better to do it manually? Because I think if we go for automation for negative testing then it will be lot of code to be done..\\\\nFor Ex: I have register form and field is there called \"Password\" , Now validations for fields are \"Password must be of minimum 6 characters and must contains letter,digit and special character\"\\\\nSo in above case positive automation will be easy as I will test direct by insert valid password , But for negative testing of that field will have lot of cases so should we do automation for that? \\\\nPlease let me know best way for negative testing. Right now I am preferring manually.\\\\nis there any way to test an application which is already installed For Eg. i want to test the calculator or google map application ?\\\\nmy Current Appium version is 1.3.4.1\\\\nI started work as junior QA and after 2 months of manual testing my boss told me to learn about automation. \\\\nThe problem is that I should test app which has been written in JavaScript for Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows Mobile. I searched for topics on the internet but I didn\\\\\\'t found anything interesting. \\\\nDoes anyone have any advice?\\\\nI have written some tests in Selenium using NodeJs and I am looking for a way to use those tests for stress testing web apps. Is there any tool that combined with selenium can do the trick?\\\\nWhat I am actually looking for is a tool that is \"Selenium like\". Basically I want to open a webpage and execute custom javascript in the console to perform my tests. The extra part that selenium does not cover is running the test multiple simultaneous times.\\\\nI am trying to download a file from a website using a webdriver. But my browser is shutting down before it was able to properly export. I inserted a wait() before I call dispose() but it is not waiting for the time I have specified.\\\\nI am doing an implicit wait.\\\\ndriver.Manage().Timeouts().ImplicitlyWait(new TimeSpan(0, 0, seconds));\\\\n\\\\nSeems to do nothing.\\\\nAny ideas??\\\\nIsn\\\\\\'t end to end already tested when you do different levels of functional tests?\\\\nFor example:\\\\n1. Test A -> B (but to do this, need to do x -> z)\\\\n2. Test C -> F (but to do this, need to do A -> B)\\\\n3. and so on...\\\\nI am going through some examples and some books in relation to Cucumber usage and it looks like @And annotation is never being caught by the regex. I mean it is a valid Gherkin keyword and it is being used in the scenarios but I can see no references to it in the actual code.\\\\nWhy is that?\\\\nI have a html div like this \\\\n<div if=\"url\" class=\"img-alt__graphic ng-scope\" ng-style=\"ieCSSFilters\" style=\"background-image: url(www.xxxxxxx.com;size=270x360);\"></div>\\\\n\\\\nIn this div tag I don\\\\\\'t have an id attribute, so how do I use the class attribute to check if the image is loaded or not? \\\\nCode Snippet: \\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.By; \\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.JavascriptExecutor; \\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; \\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebElement; \\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;\\\\n\\\\npublic class QA {\\\\n    public WebDriver driver; \\\\n    private String baseUrl;\\\\n\\\\n    public static void main(String[] args) { \\\\n        QA mv =new QA(); \\\\n        mv.launch_test(); \\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    public void launch_test() \\\\n    { \\\\n        driver = new FirefoxDriver(); \\\\n        baseUrl = \"http://www.optimum.net\"; \\\\n        driver.get(baseUrl);\\\\n\\\\n        WebElement image1 = driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//div[contains(@class,\\\\\\'global-header__brand\\\\\\')]\"));    \\\\n\\\\n        Boolean imageLoaded1 = (Boolean) ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript(\"return arguments[0].complete && typeof arguments[0].naturalWidth != \"undefined\" && arguments[0].naturalWidth > 0\", image1); \\\\n        if (!imageLoaded1) \\\\n        {\\\\n            System.out.println(\"1.

Got it\"); \\\\n        }\\\\n\\\\n        driver.close(); \\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nWe have a lot of tests in QADirector. The largest of our 26 projects has more than 1100 test scripts. Since QADirector is no longer supported, I\\\\\\'m looking for possible migration paths.\\\\nThe only know migration path to me is to SilkCentral using the SilkCentral \\\\nTestManager Migration Utility (PDF). However, we don\\\\\\'t own a SilkCentral license (yet) and according to the feedback of the support, they have never migrated such a large database.\\\\nAre there other alternatives for converting the tests of QADirector into a format matching any other test tool?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m aware the nature of this question could be flagged as \"too broad\". If your vote for \"too broad\", please proove your flag by mentioning at least one possible way in the comments - because I doubt there is more than one (if any) answer out there.\\\\nI have been trying to mouse hover on element , first time it hover properly and hold but then never it does same. I can see that it is trying to hold hover but runs too fast and effect comes like just blink on element.\\\\nMy code :\\\\nWebElement hover =  driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//*[@id=\\\\\\'frmDashboard\\\\\\']/div[1]/div[1]/ul/li[4]/a\"));\\\\n\\\\n Actions action = new Actions(driver);\\\\n action.moveToElement(element).build().perform();\\\\n\\\\nI have tried all type of wait , sleep methods here but no success.\\\\nI have made a Windows Forms app to host my GUI for running selenium tests. \\\\nWhen the user presses the \"run test\" button, it launches an instance of chromedriver and runs the selected selenium test.\\\\nHowever, let\\\\\\'s say that while the test is running, the user decides they want to stop the test, or simply not have the entire test run. \\\\nI have a button on the form that calls FixtureTearDown() in case this were to happen. FixtureTearDown is simply:\\\\nif (_driver != null) _driver.Quit();\\\\n\\\\nHowever, if you DO press this \"stop test\" button, the driver closes, but the selenium test keeps executing the script as if the webdriver were still open, which then throws errors (because it can\\\\\\'t find elements because the driver is closed, duh) and causes my Windows Forms app to crash.\\\\nSo, is there a way to gracefully halt the running of a selenium script? Thanks in advance for the help, and i apologize if this is a dumb question, i am still new to selenium and c# in general.\\\\nOur vision is to have central storage of consolidated test cases across all departments and to store it as a separate project in HP ALM. This would allow us to collect test cases across different projects and store it in a common project in HP ALM.\\\\nIs this a good approach and what pro\\\\\\'s / cons will it give us?\\\\nMany projects are using BPT testing and some projects are  doing manual testing in HP ALM.\\\\nWe are currently looking at Testrail as an alternative to using the Zephyr plugin within JIRA as Testrail looks to give us better test case and reporting management than Zephyr does.\\\\nCurrently faced with the usual problem when changing tools of how to migrate our existing test cases from one to the other.\\\\nI know there are importer tools to get Excel spreadsheet cases into Testrail, so that is ok. The problem I\\\\\\'m facing is how to get the test scripts out of Zephyr.\\\\nDoes anyone know of any similar plugins to export test cases/scripts from Zephyr to Excel?\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve tried using the inbuilt export function, but it only seems to export the basic case details, not the individual test steps.\\\\nAny help greatly appreciated.\\\\nThe HTTP Request I used in my performance testing uses JMeter\\\\\\'s XPath Extractor in order to get the response data of the HTTP Request. \\\\nWhen the test ran, the response data for the same HTTP request is different. \\\\nWhat could cause this to happen?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m currently adding some users and then wanted to check if that one user made it in the dropdown, and if it does make it, then select it. \\\\nIf it doesn\\\\\\'t make it in the dropdown, I want it so spit out an error but don\\\\\\'t want it to stop the script, just to go to another part of the script (and continue looping).\\\\n]\\\\nin my project I started code coverage for unit and integration test with gradle + jacoco. It\\\\\\'s already working and generating reports.\\\\nI saw a lot of questions and tutorials about how to do code coverage for both tests, but I didn\\\\\\'t see any question about why do code coverage for integration test. Which type of data do we expect for integration test (code coverage)? The same as unit test?\\\\nWhy I\\\\\\'m asking this: On unit test, we explicit call methods, objects and other system under test code. In this scenario, jacoco understand this and do a metric for code coverage based on what methods/properties is being called. And this is ok, makes sense to me. But on integration test, I only use some model classes to use in test and jacoco only report this models as being code coverage but not the methods being used during the tests.\\\\nMakes sense to do a code coverage for integration test? Which type of data do we expect? Or my integration test code coverage is wrong?\\\\nI developed a web service for uploading files to the server, this web service will be used by 45k users approximately. \\\\nI started to load test my application with JMeter and I\\\\\\'m a newbie in software performance.\\\\nI tested with different values in Thread Group (Number of Threads and Rump-Up Period) ex: 1000 and 200, 1000 and 300. I see always all requests response are \"200 OK\" but I don\\\\\\'t find all requests files stored in the folder (generally the number of files found is equal to the Rump-Up Period).\\\\nAny help, please?    \\\\nHello I\\\\\\'m having a slight issue. I\\\\\\'m using selenium to make a report through ExtentReport which saves a HTML file. I want to be able to save this file dynamically.\\\\nThis is the code im currently using.\\\\nreport = new ExtentReports(\"/Users/xxxx/Desktop/ExtentReport/ExtentReport.html\" + System.currentTimeMillis());\\\\n\\\\nAdding System.CurrentTimeMills kind of works as it saves it but it ends up being ExtentReport.html1919191919191919191 which works. \\\\nThe problem that I have is that after I run my selenium test I want it to navigate to the folder and open the HTML as soon as the test is over.\\\\nIf I use currentTime then I can\\\\\\'t open the file as it is made and called about a minute inbetween giving different file names.\\\\nThis is the code I use to call it after the test is over.\\\\nString Path =\"file:/Users/xxxxx/Desktop/ExtentReport/ExtentReport.html\" + System.currentTimeMillis();\\\\ndriver.get(Path);\\\\n\\\\nHow can I save my html file dynamically whilst still being able to call it later on during my script to open?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m preparing myself to exam of ISTQB Advanced Level - Technical Test Analyst. I\\\\\\'ve just finished the chapter and after that I still can\\\\\\'t answer on questions asked on the beginning of it. I.e. I\\\\\\'m not sure about my answers. \\\\nSo, I\\\\\\'d like to ask you to verify my responses:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nExplain the stages in an application\\\\\\'s lifecycle where non-functional tests and architecture based-test tests may be applied.\\\\n  Explain the causes of non-functional testing taking place only in\\\\n  specific stages of application\\\\\\'s lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNon-functional tests can be applied in any stage of an application\\\\\\'s lifecycle. Some of non-functional characteristic like efficiency depends of quality of a single components. Therefore execution efficiency should be already tested at the unit or integration level.\\\\nSome non-functional testing does not have sense until late in the Software Development Life Cycle. It is not possible to measure a characteristic like usability before the product is not integrated into one system. \\\\n(I don\\\\\\'t understand what does architecture based-test tests mean. Can someone explain this term for me?)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGive examples of the criteria that influence the structure and level of test condition development\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a marketing requirements document and a system requirements document then you can use the former to generate high-level test conditions and then use the latter to elaborate same low-level test conditions underneath each high-level one.\\\\nQuality risk analyst - we can outline the key features and quality characteristics at a high level. These quality risk items are thus the test high-level test conditions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDescribe how test analysis and design are static testing techniques that can be used to discover defects.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe process of test analysis and design needs to precise understanding the requirements specification, design specification, or other documents used as input into process. It allows identify defects in the documentation. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nExplain by giving examples the concept of the test oracle and how a test oracle can be used in test specifications\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTo be honest, I don\\\\\\'t understand this exercise.

I work in a medical industry web application. I was assigned a module to test. I did a lot of research and risk analysis and logged at least 25 bugs/problems. Now I think that the developers are mad at me, as it indicates that their coding is not good enough and is a direct attack on their work efficiency, quality, and productivity. I see that they don\\\\\\'t talk to me and are ignoring me. I have increased their work. They have fixed a few bugs but want to reject others. I have filed GUI defects, business process flow issues, etc.\\\\nShould I stop filing too many bugs in the future, as it will show that I just file them without researching, just to get noticed? It seems like I want to increase the bug count.\\\\nI am using selenium webdriver under python on a Debian jessie machine. The browser I am currently testing is Chrome (version 55) with chromedriver (version 2.27).\\\\nIf I send the string 1/2/3 to a textarea input with send_keyswhat gets inserted is 321.\\\\nNote that when I use the Firefox geckodriver, I do not see this behavior. \\\\nUPDATE: After some more investigation, I believe my problems lies with my Windows/X-windows communication. Some detail: for testing I normally open a Cygwin X-Windows session on my Windows desktop, ssh into a Linux server inside that X-windows session, and run the Selenium tests on that Linux server. This is where I see the strange problem with the forward slashes. However, when I run the tests directly on the Linux server with its own X-Windows session, the problem goes away. But I really want this testing to work with the Windows environment, so I still need a solution.\\\\nI have my selenium test send an email whenever there is an error, this is hard coded into my test however I am looking to see if it is possible to call it from an external file so I can just edit the Email file instead of having to go into the code and change it.\\\\nThe way i\\\\\\'m getting it to email is\\\\ntry {\\\\n\\\\n}\\\\ncatch (Exception e) {\\\\n    e.printStackTrace();\\\\n    new SendMail(\"senderemail\",\"reciveremail\",e); } \\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nWhich calls it directly from:\\\\npublic SendMail(String fromMail,String tomail, Exception e ) {\\\\n    Properties props = new Properties();\\\\n    props.put(\"mail.smtp.host\", \"smtp.gmail.com\");\\\\n    props.put(\"mail.smtp.socketFactory.port\", \"465\");\\\\n    props.put(\"mail.smtp.socketFactory.class\",\"javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory\");\\\\n    props.put(\"mail.smtp.auth\", \"true\");\\\\n    props.put(\"mail.smtp.port\", \"465\");\\\\n    Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(props, new javax.mail.Authenticator() {\\\\n        protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {\\\\n            return new PasswordAuthentication(\"xxxxxxx\",\"xxxxxx\");\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: How can I get my selenium to get a list from an external file of emails to send them out?\\\\n\\\\nEdit: Updated code of what finally works.\\\\nString fileName = \"/Users/cdolan/Desktop/liness.txt\";\\\\nString Email = \"\";\\\\n\\\\ntry(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName)) {  \\\\n    while ((Email = br.readLine()) !=null) {\\\\n        <Test code here goes here>\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\ncatch(Exception e) {\\\\n    e.printStackTrace();\\\\n    new SendMail(\"email123@gmail.com\",Email,e); }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m automating the input to a search bar; the program work fine when using chrome driver, but fails when I try to use PhantomJS.\\\\nThe text that should go in the search bar is not being typed properly:\\\\nWebElement searchBar =  driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\"input.sbox-ui-input\"));\\\\n\\\\nsearchBar.sendKeys(query);\\\\nutil.waitFor(3); // we wait to get all the possible suggestions\\\\nsearchBar.sendKeys(Keys.ENTER);\\\\n\\\\nI also tried this code:\\\\nActions action = new Actions(driver);\\\\naction.sendKeys(searchBar, query).build().perform();\\\\n\\\\nNone of them are working.

Or maybe I shouldn\\\\\\'t have to worry about the specific details of the app?\\\\netc\\\\n\\\\nIn short, do devs like being bothered by testers? If the answer is yes, where is the line I shouldn\\\\\\'t cross?\\\\nWorking with programmers and customers I find it is sometimes harder for me to verify the fix for a defect, than to fix a defect for a developer.\\\\nJust a simple example is when there is NullPointerException thrown by a method. A bug report contains no steps to reproduce the issue, just a stacktrace. Given such a poor report, a developer corrects the code so the method swallows such exceptions or re-write the method. Then he marks the defect as fixed. \\\\nAs a tester I usually care more about the context. Why null values arrived to the method? Which component produced it and why? So simply swallowing the exception is not a solution: it probably did\\\\\\'t removed the error. Rather it masked it.\\\\nThis kind of problems usually happens, when someone else reported a bug (not me), for instance a customer representative, and I see the bug report only when verifying the fix.\\\\nSo it all boils down to the quality of bug report. If steps to reproduce weren\\\\\\'t written before fixing the bug, they must be identified after the fix. And then it is often hard to do it, because I need to check-out/setup two system versions from SVN: one before the fix, and another after the fix was committed.\\\\nSo how can we improve the process?\\\\n\\\\nShouldn\\\\\\'t testers and devs complete the bug report with steps to reproduce before fixing it? I don\\\\\\'t care who will do it, but I think such a step should be present in the bug lifecycle here.\\\\nIf devs and testers cannot collect information from customer to reproduce the bug, should they patch it (as in the example above) or reject a bug report as \"cannot reproduce\"?\\\\n\\\\nEDIT: Maybe I wasn\\\\\\'t clear enough. I haven\\\\\\'t asked how to write a good bug report. I\\\\\\'m rather looking for practical ways to make devs, customer representative, business analysts, me, etc. complete a bug report as it goes through our hands. Some solutions other have proposed so far:\\\\n\\\\nintroduce templates in bug reports\\\\nreview good and bad reports with stakeholders to demonstrate how they help or hinder reproducing bugs and fixing them\\\\ngently ask customer for more details (talking to a customer seems a separate art to me), particularly for what they did before the failure occurred. \\\\n\\\\nParticularly, I haven\\\\\\'t seen any answer what a dev should provide in a bug report after fixing the bug? Root cause? What areas were touched? How were they changed? In which revision change was committed?  \\\\nHow effective is Visual studio test suite than load runner?\\\\nI would like to learn performance/load test a web application, but i got really confused to choose which tool to go for. \\\\nDoes the scope of VSTS 2010 is better than Loadrunner, considering the cost of the license too? \\\\nPS: I\\\\\\'m new to performance testing, please recommend a tool which is good for a beginner.

We don\\\\\\'t have much (or any) control of the deployed environment, hence the only way to test our integration is truly working is using browser automation on the client\\\\\\'s webpage.  We don\\\\\\'t want to interfere with our tracking and analytics, and more importantly, the client\\\\\\'s analytics (which is very important to verifying their ROI). What is the most convenient and effective way to block Google Analytics in the context of selenium browser automation?\\\\nI have found a few approaches:\\\\n\\\\nGoogle Analytics Opt Out Browser Add On\\\\nEditing the hosts file to redirect Google Analytics to localhost  (I\\\\\\'m not too happy about this solution since in the past it has broken some of our integration files)\\\\nOther browser specific extensions, Block yourself from GA extension for Chrome and Google Disconnect for Firefox.\\\\n\\\\nThe situation\\\\nI need to start building automated regression for a very large web application with thousands of users. It is impossible to start from a known state, or even to be sure that data entered into the application will be saved to a known state. The application is a payroll entry system, where all data is read only if payroll has not been started, and has an insane number of configuration choices.\\\\nThe application can\\\\\\'t be run on a local database with a local setup: it requires multiple interlocking web services (which use - don\\\\\\'t ask me why - the system registry to determine where to submit their results) and is not practical to reset (a database refresh can take all day). The test sandbox environment can be accessed by multiple users and configurations changed in ways that completely alter the expected behavior of the system. the development sandbox environment is often out of action for days at a time when large projects are being worked on.\\\\nThe strategies I see as viable\\\\nThe potential strategies I\\\\\\'m considering are:\\\\n\\\\nSet my initial conditions first - This is - alas - a bit more complex than it looks. I would need to make either several database queries or do a number of screenscrapes to determine whether the company has had its configuration changed, and whether I need to start a payroll run, change the configuration back to what it should be, then submit the false run before starting a clean run with the correct configuration. This would also complicate end-of-test checks because I would then need to find and discard the initial submit file in order to check the validity of the one with the data my tests actually entered. On the plus side, the values saved to the pending transaction tables prior to submit and the contents of the submit file would match expectations.\\\\nDynamic checking of results - by this I mean the much more complex coding needed to check results based on which configuration flags are active when I test, regardless of whether they\\\\\\'re what I expect to see. The advantages I see here are that I wouldn\\\\\\'t need to try to force the system to the settings I was starting with, and I\\\\\\'d be building in an oblique check that certain fields display only when certain configuration flags are enabled. On the flip side, this is a great deal more complicated to code properly, and as a result, much more error-prone.\\\\nHybrid approach - where I set certain key values but let the rest do whatever someone else set them to. This would give me some of the disadvantages of each method, but would allow me to limit the extra complexity to areas that tend to be moving targets anyway. \\\\n\\\\nSome other considerations\\\\nI have (after six months experience with the system) a reasonable grasp of where the system interacts with web services (these are all built and maintained in-house, but tend not to get much development. They also typically get called from the web application or poll the web application database, so testing them separately isn\\\\\\'t on the agenda at this stage). The web services are integral to the system to an extent that it\\\\\\'s not possible to simply test only the web application. \\\\nThe application is written is classic ASP. There is no way to separate front end and business logic. It is not unit tested because it is not unit testable. While there is a plan to replace it with a better engineered system, I will be testing this system for at least another 2 years, potentially longer. \\\\nGiven these \"interesting\" complexities, what approach should I take to building automated regression for this application? \\\\nTerminology Update\\\\nIn response to @user246 requesting clarification of some of the terminology I used:\\\\n\\\\nsubmit the false run - by this I mean to submit a payroll that contains nothing but a change of configuration settings where I don\\\\\\'t actually care what gets sent. \\\\nsubmit file - This one is a bit more complex. All the calculation logic and check generation logic happens in a back end server I have no access to. My only interface to the back end server is a fixed length format text file: the submit file. This file is generated for every payroll submission, with a defined naming convention. When there is more than one payroll submission in a short timeframe for a given customer, it can be difficult to find the one that contains the information I\\\\\\'m interested in.\\\\npending transaction tables - between the start of a payroll run and submitting the run, everything that happens is recorded to one of a number of database tables. They\\\\\\'re known as the pending transaction tables because changes to configuration, payroll, and personnel data are not final until everything has been synched between the web application and the back end server. Until a payroll run is submitted, changes aren\\\\\\'t permanent, and depending on the logic involved can exist only in the pending transaction tables.\\\\n\\\\nSeveral of my team\\\\\\'s QC users have complained about the text in description & comments fields being too small to read.

The problem is, that our developers very often hate testing and even if they have a test protocol, not all of them are really testing. Very often they are asking their colleagues instead of testing themselves where the bugs were and practices like this. They are very often not very interested to do a good job.\\\\nThis is of course a general problem and they could got fired for such an attitude. But in reality things aren\\\\\\'t as simple as this.\\\\nMy question now is if there are clever tactics which prevent them from cheating. I would let some random errors occur for each tester to prevent it, but as they are the developers it\\\\\\'s nearly impossible to prevent searching the source code for these errors. Another idea would be to offer a reward for the person who found the most bugs. Or don\\\\\\'t let multiple people test the same things (but this reduces the quality of the tests).\\\\nWhat are your clever suggestions to \"force\" the developers to really test and give them no possibility to cheat?

Im not talking about a lot of major stuff. But little things (especially if it\\\\\\'s a large website). How do I not beat myself up over this?\\\\nWhat can you do about design things? Is QA expected to notice these things? (Especially without reference).

If you want to know, for example, if your system\\\\\\'s performance got better or worse after some code changes, you can compare the time taken to perform certain actions (ideally all actions) before and after these changes.\\\\nFor functional requirements, however, whether the system got better or worse since the previous version is a more subjective issue. A simple comparison of the number of failed test cases across versions may bring misleading results, as this does not account for the importance of the test case nor the impact of the problem on the user experience. One could even try to give appropriate weights to the test cases according to their importance, but I think the rules to assign the weights would themselves be subjective.\\\\nWhat kind of metrics can be used as an indicative of how well a piece of software meets its functional requirements? \\\\nAs a developer my knowledge of best QA practices, etc., are limited to know just enough to get me by writing unit tests, etc. \\\\nFrom a tester\\\\\\'s point of view, what testing procedures should the developer ideally have gone through before signing off a project to the QA team to be tested? \\\\nObviously this will vary based on what development methodology is in place, so different answers based on different methodologies would be fantastic.

There is no insight into the actual data over them (those are internal buses, so scopes or logic analyzers can\\\\\\'t be used) I am using a top-down approach using high level tests to infer that the underlying code is really working.\\\\nAnyone tested similar systems and can share tips on testing ?\\\\nVersion control for test assets is a no brainer, but dropping a Rational Functional Tester directly into VC hasn\\\\\\'t been easy.  Attempting to use a tool like Subversion with multiple users modifying the same project has exposed issues with corrupted object maps and required additional reformatting of these maps when committing to avoid this problem.  Can anyone provide a good method or tool that they use to keep their RFT project versioned properly?\\\\nUPDATE: One of the major issues we noticed with using Subversion and the RFT project was that merging changes to the object map by more than one person had problems.  The map is kept as a single line XML file, so when two different resources change it and Subversion attempts the merge, it fails when comparing the two single line XML files. We discovered a way around this with some reformatting, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution.\\\\nAt my firm, we don\\\\\\'t really have a QA department. If you\\\\\\'ve followed some of my other questions you know essentially, we have no automated tests and our \\\\\\'testers\\\\\\' are the analysts who design the projects.\\\\nWhen I recently brought up the idea of a more formal (I actually used the term \\\\\\'industry standard\\\\\\') QA department, I was told \"The decision was made to go to a lean development process.\" Turns out that decision was made about 7 or 8 years ago. Only in the last 5 months have I convinced them to move to a 2 week deploy cycle (it was 3-4 months before) and only in the last month are they cutting a \\\\\\'build\\\\\\' that goes for the \\\\\\'testers\\\\\\' to test. Also, any changes necessary are made to that \\\\\\'build\\\\\\' (the code is able to be compiled or interpreted, so modification is easy.) The reason \\\\\\'build\\\\\\' is in quotes is because it\\\\\\'s really just a copy of trunk, with the most recent changes put higher up in the path so they get found first, and it all gets interpreted on the fly.\\\\nSo, it seems there\\\\\\'s a fundamental misunderstanding of what \"lean development\" is. They had a QA department in the past, but were bothered by their lack of productivity. Of course, we know that a QA department isn\\\\\\'t \\\\\\'productive\\\\\\'. If you look at it from a manufacturing point of view (which they do,) QA by definition hinders productivity by increasing the chance of failed and extended-time projects. (We\\\\\\'ve tried using the argument that QA for software is like QA for the products they manufacture. They don\\\\\\'t see it the same way because there\\\\\\'s government mandates for their QA, but not for the software.)\\\\nHow can I convince them that a formal QA will benefit the company?\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve seen testers (Michael Bolton, mainly) make a distinction between \"testing\" (looking for defects using a variety of different methods) and \"checking\" (running a scenario and then verifying a set of facts which, if false, imply a defect in the product).  Under these definitions, checking is a subset of testing.  \\\\nExamples:  Most automated regression tests would be \"checking\".  Manual testing that doesn\\\\\\'t go \"off the rails\" would be manual checking, but as soon as a tester leaves a script and starts investigating other behavior, they\\\\\\'ve started exploratory testing.  Ad-hoc testing would not be checking.  Fuzzing and stability testing would normally not be \"checks\", but automated exploratory tests.\\\\nI feel like there are a number of cases where people say, \"Tests should have feature X\", but then there are 10 exceptions to the rule.  However, many of these statements seem to be truer and clearer when stated as \"Checks should have feature X\".  For example, \"Given the same inputs, automated checks should always produce the same outputs unless there is a change to the code.\"  However, there are many tests (stability, performance, semi-random input, etc.) that would naturally have some level of variation in their outputs that are useful but do not meet this criteria.  However, I also can see how this distinction could seem overly pedantic.  \\\\nConcluding question, or,\\\\nTL;DR: Is the idea of \"checking\" as a subset of testing a useful one?\\\\nP.S. Edits to link articles / sources for this concept will be appreciated, if anyone here knows what I\\\\\\'m talking about.\\\\nP.P.S.  What I\\\\\\'m trying to get at is, \\\\\\'Is a distinction between \"testing\" vs. \"checking\" like this useful\\\\\\', not \\\\\\'Is it used?\\\\\\'  I know it\\\\\\'s not a commonly used concept, but it is a concept that people have been trying to introduce. Does the concept of \"checking\" to describe a subset of \"testing\" help with communication about tests and testing?  Would it be a good thing to introduce it to tester / QA vocabulary?\\\\nI work on several projects were the client wants basically the same application implemented in both iOS and Android. At the end of the day, you have to test both - they are distinct pieces of software, just wondered if anyone has found any tips / tricks here. We\\\\\\'ve started doing client acceptance testing with one platform, then using this as a baseline for the 2nd platform - this kinda though turns into a \\\\\\'spot the difference\\\\\\' competition.\\\\nHere\\\\\\'s the basic setup - over a number of years the testing team at my workplace has developed a sophisticated (probably rather more complex than strictly necessary) object-oriented, data-driven framework for our company\\\\\\'s software product (a suite of intercommunicating applications that operate transactionally - that is, more than just data entry).\\\\nAn unfortunate combination of events has left the team with a manager who knows little about the product, and me as the automation expert. One new hire with a lot of experience in relatively static data-entry automation and the manager are convinced that the automation framework is \"too complex\" and the reason it takes too long to get automation running.\\\\nHow do I convince them that despite the complexity the framework is a robust, reliable tool and their preferred solution (glorified record and playback with a host of duplicated functions because of the transactional nature of the system) is a maintenance nightmare in the making? (I maintain the things. I know which ones are easier to debug and maintain.)\\\\nAny advice here is welcome - my team is grossly overloaded with no sign of relief any time soon so I really want to avoid anything that could make things worse.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m a developer. Right now we don\\\\\\'t have much in my firm in the way of testers. Whether I do it here, or go to a different firm, I\\\\\\'m very interested in becoming a full time tester. \\\\n\\\\nHow would I prepare for a transition like this? I know I can read blogs and articles, but I\\\\\\'m looking for something more substantial.\\\\nWhat applications should I expect to be using (that I might be able to maybe even get a trial license to learn my way around?) Even if I\\\\\\'m not using it at the position I go to, I may find valuable insight from using it.\\\\n\\\\nWhat sort of things should I study up on (that can be put on my resume, or otherwise dropped in a phone screen or interview? And yes, I plan to research and understand it, and use it in my personal projects, not just win a second round of interviews based on buzzwords.)\\\\n\\\\nThe term \"Test Automation Framework\" is become a cliche in automated testing.\\\\nI have come across circumstances during work when my colleagues developed some reusable methods/function for an automation tool and propose it as if they have developed an automation framework. This is also often portrayed in Resumes.\\\\nI personally find test automation framework a very wide term which might include (and not limited to) - language support, IDE support, Test Report Generation, Recovery Mechanism, Test Execution Scheduling, Test Report delivery mechanism etc etc. \\\\nCreating some reusable methods in a language should/may not qualify as a framework, though it may add to over all framework. But then how do I let them know that their creation is not a framework?\\\\nActually php undercontrol seems to consume a lot of memory so I\\\\\\'m looking for replacement, in order to test a php application.\\\\nWhen websites being deployed to the internet are about to go live, the age old question always comes up. \"Which browsers should I test?\"\\\\nI am not asking that question because it will soon become obsolete. So, what I would like to know is what information or techniques are available to determine which browsers to test.\\\\nIn the past I have used the wikipedia page of browser market share as the primary guide plus adding any soon to be realised browsers to the list, based on this criteria.\\\\n\\\\nIt is used by a significant portion of a sites users, and is in common, widespread usage.\\\\nIt is the default browser on the latest version of Windows or Mac OS X.\\\\nIt is a newly released, or about to be released browser which is expected to quickly gain a significant portion of browser market share, e.g. the current in beta version of IE.\\\\n\\\\nIs this the best technique available or is there something better?\\\\nI am preparing an initial test plan document for a new project. The project involves several layers of HW and software and requires mainly black box testing but also some level of grey box testing (getting readings from within the code, but without actually reading or modifying the code).\\\\nThe goal of this document is to assess the feasibility of the project from testing point of view- required test equipment, time, personnel, needed automation etc. \\\\nThe approach I am going to use is to start by using a table with test types on one side (Functional, Performance, Stability) and modules/sub modules on the other side (GUI, computation engine, API from A to B etc.) then fill each square with high level headline for tests. When done, the table gives a pretty good idea of the project.\\\\nI tried using MindMaps in the past, they were great for brain storming but quickly lost focus.\\\\nAny other ideas ?\\\\nRobot Framework claims to be:\\\\n\\\\na generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach.\\\\n\\\\nMy first impression is that there will be challenges in maintaining tests that combine natural-language text files with real code (as in Fit, Fitnesse) comparing to tests written purely in code. However, that\\\\\\'s my only first impression.\\\\nAre tests written in Robot Framework easy to maintain? Why yes? Why not?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m creating an API testing framework, and to avoid having a test class containing 1000\\\\\\'s of lines of code I\\\\\\'m looking at creating separate classes which will hold the xml data, which I\\\\\\'ll then call in my test.\\\\nMy initial thoughts were to create a payload class which would contain the XML elements for my test(an example is below)\\\\npublic class CreateOrderPayload\\\\n{\\\\n    public static string OrderPayload()\\\\n    {\\\\n        XDocument OrderData = new XDocument();\\\\n        XElement root = new XElement(\"Order\");\\\\n        DateTime now = DateTime.Now;\\\\n\\\\n        root.Add(new XElement(\"BillingAddress\",\\\\n            new XElement(\"AddressLine1\", \"Canada adress 17\"),\\\\n            new XElement(\"AddressLine2\", \"ccc\"),\\\\n        root.Add(new XElement(\"Customer\",\\\\n            new XElement(\"ContactNumber\", \"ContactNum\"),\\\\n            new XElement(\"EmailAddress\", \"andy@test.com\"),\\\\n        root.Add(new XElement(\"OriginalOrderId\", \"2315923148\"));\\\\n        root.Add(new XElement(\"Source\", \"fffff\"));\\\\n\\\\n        OrderData.Add(root);\\\\n\\\\n        return OrderData.ToString();\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nIn my actual test I\\\\\\'d then look to call the above class so that I can grab the payload to use for my test. I\\\\\\'m using RestSharp to do this so would initialise my test with something like the below:\\\\n        restClient = new RestClient(Constants.CRCOrderApi);\\\\n        restRequest = new RestRequest(Method.POST);\\\\n\\\\nWhat I\\\\\\'m trying to work out is how I would grab the XML from my CreateOrderPayload class to pass across into my test?\\\\nWhen isolating a root cause of a failing test written in Python or Java, I use a debugger built in my IDE (e.g., Intellij) to debug it.\\\\nIs the same possible for Robot tests? \\\\nParticularly, what\\\\\\'s a support for debugging Robot tests in IDEA Intellij?\\\\nI wonder because I found Robot tests are a mix of both .robot and .py / .java fies.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m SM for an agile team.  One of our testers opened a couple of defects on a story (that really wasn\\\\\\'t ready to be tested - but that\\\\\\'s another issue). Before those defects were resolved, the tester continued to go through the remaining scripts and opened another defect.  Didn\\\\\\'t go over very well.  Here\\\\\\'s my question - Is it standard practice to piecemeal defects as you find them, or to test the entire story and THEN hand over the defects?  I would think all at once would be better, but I\\\\\\'m not a programmer and I can\\\\\\'t find any guidance online for this scenario. Thoughts?\\\\nI tried using a regex for numbers only but it didn\\\\\\'t work.\\\\nBlow snapshot shows my configuration. i tried various combinations like contains, matches etc. \\\\nI\\\\\\'m responsible strictly for documenting and unit-testing a Golang project. In the part of the SUT I\\\\\\'m currently on, a real file, identified by a file path, is being checked for its \"Last modified by\" time.\\\\nIts code is thus: \\\\n// AssetTimePath returns a timestamped path\\\\n//\\\\n// Parameters:\\\\n//\\\\n// - `s` :  the URL of the file\\\\n//\\\\n// Returns:\\\\n//\\\\n// - the timestamped path\\\\n// - any errors\\\\nfunc (view *View) AssetTimePath(s string) (string, *errors.ErrorSt) {\\\\n    if strings.HasPrefix(s, \"//\") {\\\\n        return s, nil\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    s = strings.TrimLeft(s, \"/\")\\\\n    abs, err := filepath.Abs(s)\\\\n\\\\n    if err != nil {\\\\n        return \"\", errors.File().AddDetails(err.Error())\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    time, err2 := utilities.FileTime(abs)\\\\n    if err2 != nil {\\\\n        return \"\", err2\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    return view.PrependBaseURI(s + \"?\" + time), nil\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nThe problem\\\\nTo happy-path test this function, I would need to create a real file, maybe somehow track its absolute pathname, and delete the file afterwards. This seems inconsistent with unit-testing, as it is concerned with isolating all other factors to test individual units of work (such as the fact that there\\\\\\'s even a string containing, but not ending with, ? iff the file exists).\\\\nIs it ever acceptable, in a unit-test, to create a real file for testing?\\\\nIf not, is this even fully testable?\\\\nUPDATE : I overlooked the fact that I could just pass in the name of the very file the tests, or even this part of the SUT, is written in! \\\\nThe spirit of this question still remains...\\\\nI\\\\\\'m using Selenium with Visual Studio 2017 on an ASP.NET MVC application. Driver is ChromeDriver 2.42.01. Everything works, however one of my tests involves clicking a div which is wrapped into an anchor:\\\\n<a class=\"allowed\" href=\"javascript:loadRegistrationPopUp(10031)\">\\\\n  <div class=\"selectContentContainer class-time\">\\\\n    ...\\\\n  </div>\\\\n</a>\\\\n\\\\nThe function is causing an error because it is undefined. \\\\nLooking at the page source in Chrome, I find that a major part of the Javascript is missing, particularly the line that includes my script bundle where the function is living. If I open the very same page in a regular Chrome instance, I can see:\\\\n<script src=\"/bundles/default?v=3n...pSQ1\"></script>\\\\nBut that script include (together with the Javascript) is missing when running with Selenium.\\\\nTo make things even stranger: running the same test on another machine does work, the bundle is there. Same version of Chrome.\\\\nWhat could be causing this?\\\\nHow to identify this button in C#:\\\\n <button class=\"reward_link_redeem_button_style\" onclick=\"RedeemRPProduct(\\\\\\'free_points_1\\\\\\')\">REDEEM</button>\\\\n <button class=\"reward_link_redeem_button_style \" onclick=\"RedeemRPProduct(\\\\\\'free_points_50\\\\\\')\">REDEEM</button>\\\\n\\\\nBut there are like 4 buttons called equal, and to differentiate them you need the (\\\\\\'free_points_1\\\\\\') as well as (\\\\\\'free_points_10\\\\\\'), etc.\\\\n\\\\nI want to store issuedid in csv.\\\\nis it possible?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m using Selenium IDE for Chrome and I\\\\\\'m trying to click somewhere only if a specific element doesn\\\\\\'t exist.\\\\nIf I only wanted to do that, I can do it with an assert:\\\\nassert element not present    css=.something\\\\nclick                         css=.button\\\\n\\\\nHowever, this is part of a larger script and I want to continue with the rest of the script regardless of whether the element exists.\\\\nSo I want to do something more like:\\\\nif          {something which means roughly \"assert element not present\"}\\\\n   click    css=.button\\\\nend\\\\n\\\\nIs this possible? How do I do this?\\\\nI need a solution how to iterate value of i. Actually my test case contain one webtable and table have five column also fifth column contain four buttons. So depending on the first column value(for ex \"admin\" which is in first row) validate the value and according to that same row fifth column first button i have to click on that. I am using page object model and my all locator place in java class(for ex AddRoleLocator class name) and my actual logic present in another java class(for ex. AddRole). So that how to iterate value of i.\\\\nmy Locator key is like that\\\\npublic static By noOfRows=By.Xpath(\"//table[@id=\\\\\\'group-list\\\\\\']/tbody/tr[\"+i+\"]/td[1]\");\\\\n\\\\nThis is my actual logic\\\\nList<WebElement> noOfRows = wau.getData(KumoAccessManageLocator.KumoAccessManageTableRowCount);\\\\n            int count = noOfRows.size();\\\\n            System.out.println(count);\\\\n            for(int i=1;i<=count;i++)\\\\n            {\\\\n                if(wau.getText(KumoAccessManageLocator.KumoAccessManageRoleName).equals(ConstantProperties.getProperty(\"kumo.accessMange.newRoleName\")))\\\\n                {\\\\n                    wau.clickButton(KumoAccessManageLocator.KumoAccessManageviewRights);\\\\n                }\\\\n            }  \\\\n\\\\nso please suggest me how to resolve this problem with using page object model.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m getting the text as string and i need to compare it with a number, If its grater than that number then execute an if statement and if not then else.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m using following code :\\\\nstring sato = driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(\".user_reward_points\")).Text;\\\\nif (sato > 1200)\\\\n{\\\\n     driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(\"#free_points_rewards > .effect2:nth-\\\\n    child(2) .large-3:nth-child(3) > .reward_link_redeem_button_style\")).Click();\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nThe Story\\\\nWe have a mission critical AngularJS application which we extensively test with e2e tests using Protractor/WebdriverJS. At the current state, we have ~30000 lines of existing e2e tests which are executed daily multiple times either fully or partially for multiple different reasons (e.g. daily or smoke tests).\\\\nThe application itself is in the beginning stages of \"migrating\" to ReactJS and the biggest question our QA department is facing is whether we can keep the existing set of e2e tests. As you probably inferred from the size of the test code, we\\\\\\'ve been investing in e2e tests a lot.\\\\nWe\\\\\\'ve been following Page Object pattern and try to keep the page definitions separated from the logic of the tests.\\\\nOne of the issues that will arise if we try to adopt Protractor test codebase to work against a React-based app is that Protractor would not be able to \"sync\" with Angular on every selenium command breaking the current natural flow of the e2e tests - I would imagine we would need to put explicit and implicit waits all over the codebase to make sure desired pre-conditions are met before any actions are applied.\\\\nThe Question\\\\nWhat are the pros and cons of adjusting the existing test codebase to work with a ReactJS based application vs starting with e2e tests from scratch with, probably, a better \"React-friendly\" test framework? What things we should consider to make this decision?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m using RESTassured with Java. Getting response in compressed from UTF16 format.

am developing a Selenium Test Automation Framework for the purpose of testing multiple websites. \\\\nI have currently set up the Framework in Visual Studio using C# and implementing the Page Object Model. \\\\nThe Framework itself is a C# project and the Test project is separate but references the Framework. \\\\nI am happy with the fundamentals of the Framework but I want to implement some Data Driven aspects in order to increase the durability of the tests. I currently have NUnit running paramaterised test using [TestCase] but the data is hardcoded by me. \\\\nThe ideal scenario would be to add a DatabaseHelper class to the Framework which would allow me to define queries on the database under test to return values and Nunit would repeat the same test for each row of the SQL query. \\\\nHas anyone here implemented a similar method and how would you go about creating it? \\\\nThere is a form having only two field name and Code. Code validation criteria is minimum 2 and max six character. As soon as you enter 2 character save button become enable.\\\\nNow, problem is when selenium enter two character in code save button become enable and data got saved while automating. but in reality Selenium code has to pass six characters in Code. Instead of six it is only passing two.\\\\nI am using Cucumber and POM, C# Selenium webdriver\\\\nthanks in advance\\\\nIt is said that increase in the appraisal costs (i.e. costs spent for finding non-corfomances - testing, reviews) decreases the failure costs (that comprise of internal (fixing of bugs we found + retesting ) and external failure costs (fixing bugs that customer found + retesting).\\\\nWell, I think it is only true if the cost for defects found by customer is higher. What I mean is:\\\\nwhen I invest in the testing, the cost of rework of defects it discovers will be more or less the same as if the customer discovered it. My developers are paid the same, no matter whether they fix a bug found by the customer or ourselves. Of course, there will be some overhead included and I do not take into account indirect costs like our reputation going down for producing buggy software.\\\\nBut I just do not believe the failure costs decrease as appraisal costs increase, as several books state.\\\\nTake the following situations:\\\\nMore testing, less customer defects\\\\nCost of testing: 10K (several issuses found)\\\\nRework cost of internally found defects: 5K\\\\nRework cost of externally found defects 3K\\\\nTotal=18K.\\\\nLess testing, more customer defects\\\\nCost of testing: 2K (not many issues found)\\\\nRework of issues (few ours + all from customer): 12K. (more twice as much as in the previous situation)\\\\nTotal=14K\\\\nWhat I saved on testing I spent on fixing and even saved a bit.\\\\nI need to load test a chat tool with multiple rooms and channels which will test the overall load of thousands of users from multiple locations in all of the rooms, real time live chats in at least one room (hundreds of users) and simultaneous sidebar/1:1 chats.

For this question I am going high-level as indicated by the short question title.\\\\nI have a feature file with the following:\\\\nScenario: Test something\\\\n    Given I do something to test something\\\\n\\\\nMy step definition:\\\\nimport io.cucumber.java.en.Given;\\\\n...\\\\n@Given(\"I do something to test something\")\\\\npublic void doSomething()\\\\n{\\\\n....\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nFrom my pom.xml:\\\\n    <dependency>\\\\n        <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>\\\\n        <artifactId>cucumber-testng</artifactId>\\\\n        <version>4.6.0</version>\\\\n    </dependency>\\\\n\\\\n    <dependency>\\\\n        <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>\\\\n        <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>\\\\n        <version>4.6.0</version>\\\\n    </dependency>\\\\n\\\\nWith the above, I can run my code using my runner, but in the IDE (IntelliJ IDEA) the step in the feature file is complaining about an \"Undefined step reference\". When I CTRL-left-click the step, it does not take me to the method for the step.\\\\nIf I change my import to:\\\\nimport cucumber.api.java.en.Given;\\\\n\\\\nEverything works as expected (i.e. the step is found), but then I get a warning about import cucumber.api.java.en.Given being deprecated (and the \"Given\" in my code has a line going through it).\\\\n\\\\nHow can I make my the feature file work so that when I CTRL-Left-Click on a step it will take me to the method for the step, but also avoid the \"deprecated\" warning?\\\\nThis script is not working as the string contains single quotes (\\\\\\') and double quotes (\") and comparing the string is not working in this case. \\\\n${Key1}=      set variable     It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in \\\\\\\\\"Detailing\\\\\\\\\": The Perfect Gift\\\\n${KEY_FLAG}   run keyword if   \"${Key1}\"==\"It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in \\\\\\\\\"Detailing\\\\\\\\\": The Perfect Gift\"        set variable        X1\\\\nlog     ${Key_FLAG}\\\\n\\\\nAny solution ?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m currently exploring FitNesse/Slim as an automated test tool. Scenarios are defined on a page named Example.ScenarioLibrary, and this particular test is defined on Example.T002Scripts.\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve defined a recurring scenario, which creates a task in the System Under Test, that I want to use in many different tests. However, the task names need to be different. I tried to arrange that by including ${RUNNING_PAGE_NAME} in the Slim table.\\\\n!2 Task configuration\\\\n|scenario        |create new task with duration           |duration                               |\\\\n|click           |New                                                                             |\\\\n|enter           |[TEST] ${RUNNING_PAGE_NAME} @{duration}s|as|Name                                |\\\\n\\\\nThis sort-of works, except that this produces the following Name: [TEST] <a href=\"Example.T002Scripts\">T002Scripts</a> 20s. I want (and expected) it to be [TEST] T002Scripts 20s or [TEST] Example.T002Scripts 20s (both would be fine). Is there any way to get rid of that HTML markup? I\\\\\\'ve tried other variables (${PAGE_NAME}, ${PAGE_PATH} and ${RUNNING_PAGE_PATH}) but to no avail.\\\\nHow to create Page Object for such element with Reusable Action Method ?\\\\nMethods to include:\\\\nA method to select an option from list dropdown, example: selectFromList(String option)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ncan u pls any one give suggestions about benchmark metrics i.e average time, Throughput, 90th percentile values for any websites like industry standards meant that any application wouldnt exceeds these values.\\\\ni.e \\\\ndefault Average time =3 sec\\\\ndefault throughput and 90th percentile values??\\\\nHow to handle Dynamic Request URL Path in Jmeter. This request is not recorded in Script, it dynamically appears only in Login page response where in two places.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAccording to istqb foundation level, a test charter is the following:\\\\n\"An instruction of test objectives and possible test ideas on how to test. Test charters are often used in explorative testing. See also explorative testing\".\\\\nBut the question I ask myself is, how should a test charter be built at all? \\\\nWhich points result from the explorative test ? \\\\nCan the decision on the charter also take place during the test? Or should the charter only be defined before the explorative test? \\\\nIs there a way to get scripts in Java when I record using Katalon studio ? \\\\n\\\\nLet me start with my background,\\\\nBeen in the industry for over a year, got the wonderful opportunity to join the team despite no prior background, loving and enjoying every moment so far actually. My only dilemma is that there were no senior QAs to pass down their knowledge to me.\\\\nOur teams are divided into frontend and backend, and I am part of the frontend team. As I mention, this is my first ever role, with no senior QAs passing down their knowledge. We have existing projects, but I felt like our automation weren\\\\\\'t that great, in a sense that most of them are flaky, and I was fairly new to the role, so I didn\\\\\\'t know much about automation strategy apart from the fact that - \"Automation is good! You don\\\\\\'t need to test things manually!\"\\\\nAfter a while, I realise there is some truth to that, but that doesn\\\\\\'t necessarily mean automate everything, which was my thoughts previously, to try to automate as much functionality each sprint.\\\\nNow we are starting a new project, and I am, again the sole QA for the frontend team. I would like to know how other teams approach their manual UI regression testing and also how you go about approaching automation\\\\nManual: We all know that UI is very fragile, and there are lots of part and bits of pieces to it. From my experience, anything and literally ANYTHING could happen. So how do you guys keep track of every single thing?\\\\nAutomation: From my learnings, it seems that UI automation are very flaky and should be kept to a minimum due to the always changing nature of the frontend. Since I am solely focusing on frontend, how would you guys decide on what to automate etc?\\\\nAny input would be appreciated. Would love to hear how other companies approach their frontend testing\\\\nThanks in advance\\\\nI am capturing URl and path from s3URL from previous response. Some time S3URL not generated then URL and Path not found. In this case i want to hide error because it is application issue not scripting issue.\\\\nTest object: a big monolith application (~500k loc) developed in Java for the last 15 years. Big and (probably overly) complicated backend + web frontend. There are many business processes implemented in the app. Currently there are 10 teams working on it.\\\\nTests: there are unit tests and integration tests implemented. Code coverage is at around 70%.\\\\nThere are also MANY automated system and e2e tests implemented in a commercial test tool.\\\\nIssues: \\\\n\\\\nthere are way too many system and e2e tests. They were added over the years as at first there were no other tests being written. Only after a while someone thought of adding Java-based unit and integration tests.\\\\nApart of the code coverage of the unit und integration tests the test coverage is a big unknown. The knowledge about which functionality is tested by what system test is kept only in the heads of the testers. There is no real way to know which tests need to be fixed, when a new story is implemented, other than running the regression test suite and to look what broke.\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: In my opinion we need to get rid of a big chunk of the system tests ASAP, as they are not maintainable any more, flaky and take waaay to long to run (~24h concurrently on 50 VMs). There are dead tests, that test removed functionality, many duplicates etc.\\\\nIn order to do that first I would like to know the test coverage, to be able to tell which tests are useless and can be deleted safely.\\\\nI am looking for a way to determine/estimate the test coverage in such a project \\\\nThe obvious way of connecting the test with the corresponding user story/requirement will not work, as for quite many of the implemented functions there are no documented requirements.\\\\nThe monolith is right now in the process of being refactored into roughly independent modules. The current idea is sorting the system tests based on their belonging to these modules. Additionally the tests belonging to one module can then be sorted based on the business process they test inside that module. With this I should have database of tests broken down by the modules and then by business processes, and thus a rough test coverage estimation by process and module. This still does not convince me, as being the best approach though.\\\\nSo does this make sense? How else could the test coverage be determined/estimated?\\\\nAnalyze the following highly simplified procedure:\\\\nAsk: \"What type of ticket do you require, single or return?\"\\\\nIF the customer wants \"return\"\\\\n     Ask: \"What rate, Standard or Cheap-day?\"\\\\n      IF the customer replies \"Cheap-day\"\\\\n           Say: \"That will be 11:20\"\\\\n       ELSE\\\\n            Say: \"That will be 19:50\"\\\\n       ENDIF\\\\nELSE\\\\nSay: \"That will be 9:75\"\\\\nENDIF\\\\n\\\\nNow decide the minimum number of tests that are needed to ensure that all the questions have been asked, all combinations have occurred and all replies given.\\\\nThe answer is 3. Please help with this: why the answer is 3? I do not know to justify.\\\\nLately I keep seeing articles about how artificial intelligence will revolutionize how quality assurance is done (one simple example here. There are even online courses online for AI in Software Testing.\\\\nIs AI in software testing a real thing - in terms of creating test cases, creating the appropriate tests and executing them?\\\\nWe have a problem in our development team, the development throughput is much higher than our QA members can test.\\\\nOur test team found itself in a situation where a new feature needs to be tested every two days.\\\\nSo we have to do function, regression, exploration, and other testing, this loop takes a lot of time because any change or commit in the source code forces it to repeat everything.\\\\nThey are now waiting for the developer to run his tests in the middle and before the end of the sprint. Is there some kind of best practice for such bottlenecks in the agile environment?\\\\n\\\\nSo one should rather solve the problem from the Project Owner side.\\\\nPlan fewer tasks in sprint planning? \\\\nShould tasks be rejected in order to avoid this bottleneck?\\\\nShould sprint planning be further punished?\\\\n\\\\nI already described the problem in the retro, the solution was a shortened sprint planning. But, depending on the effort, we still have the problem that we run into this bottleneck over and over again.\\\\nBut the problem is, we also write and review the test automation. But we simply can\\\\\\'t keep up with passing the \"normal\" test, adapting the automatic test at the same time or creating a new one, everything together is simply no longer achievable.\\\\n\\\\nSo should the execution of the test automation also be included in\\\\nthe sprint planning?\\\\nBut wouldn\\\\\\'t this even worsen the problem?\\\\nWhere exactly are the priorities to be defined now? Write and adapt\\\\nthe test automation, or just normal test, i.e. Explorative,\\\\nFunctional.\\\\nWhat is important Whitebox or Blackbox test?\\\\n\\\\nEspecially small teams with few testers and a lot of tasks have these problems in front of them. On the one hand we all know that in the agile world speed is everything, but it is forgotten that the QA is sometimes simply too much burdened. We are only human beings! \\\\nEven if the project owner is looking for solutions and everything was reported in the retro, not everything can be solved. Depending on the size of the project, you always have a bottleneck somewhere, and yes it is somehow desperate!\\\\nI am currently assigned to a new project, on a Scrum team that didn\\\\\\'t have a tester integrated before.  There are no test cases yet, but the project is more advanced. \\\\nSo I\\\\\\'m busy defining test cases myself right now. I would like to have my test cases checked by the developers within the Scrum team. \\\\nEven though it\\\\\\'s always very time consuming, I have to be sure at the beginning that my test cases are correctly defined and that I\\\\\\'m up to date. My test cases have to be up-to-date, right from the start. \\\\nThe project owner sees it differently and thinks that the developers are just too close to their development to decide whether a test case is set up correctly. \\\\nI see it differently, because wrong test cases are worse than time problems within a sprint. Wrong test cases that are not reviewed also blow up projects.\\\\nProblems\\\\n\\\\nA review of all new test cases would take too long for me as the only\\\\ntester in the Scrum team.\\\\nA bad review can lead to bottlenecks.\\\\nIf the test cases are not removed, I have to work constantly to adapt\\\\nthem.\\\\nIn my opinion the Project Owner does not see the problem that the\\\\ntest depends on these test cases.\\\\n\\\\nWhat have the experts and career professionals learned in this field, what wise nuggets of information can be passed on and what has been learned from real experiences ?\\\\nWhat advice from experienced professionals in the field can help me in driving change within organization and contribute to a testing mindset?\\\\nHow can I be a leader in this space?\\\\nFor example:\\\\n@FindBy(xpath = \"//div[@id=\\\\\\'panel\\\\\\']//span[@class=\\\\\\'name\\\\\\']\")\\\\nprivate WebElement panel;\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve got a panel element. Is it possible to get value of XPath that I init above?\\\\nI need a solution how can I return:\\\\n\\\\n//div[@id=\\\\\\'panel\\\\\\']//span[@class=\\\\\\'name\\\\\\']\\\\n\\\\nstring in a test.\\\\nI want to validate that field is not editable.\\\\nCode I am trying is:\\\\ndriver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//div[@comp-id=\\\\\\'1494\\\\\\']\")).click();\\\\ndriver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//div[@comp-id=\\\\\\'1494\\\\\\']\")).sendKeys(\"PleaseCHECK\");\\\\n\\\\nBut this is not working as it successfully pass this and according to my TC this is incorrect\\\\ndiv of above element (which is not editable) looks like:\\\\n<div tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"gridcell\" comp-id=\"1534\" col-id=\"FGA_PROCESSOR\" class=\"ag-cell ag-cell-not-inline-editing ag-cell-with-height ag-cell-value ag-cell-no-focus\" style=\"width: 97px; left: 1864px; \"></div>\\\\n\\\\ndiv of editable field looks like:\\\\n<div tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"gridcell\" comp-id=\"1532\" col-id=\"fgaConfigDescription\" class=\"ag-cell ag-cell-with-height ag-cell-value ag-cell-focus ag-cell-inline-editing ag-column-hover\" style=\"width: 175px; left: 1581px; \"><input class=\"ag-cell-edit-input\" type=\"text\"></div> \\\\n\\\\nOnly difference between editable and non editable fields is on INPUT tag.\\\\nI just need to make sure that the field is not editable and doesn\\\\\\'t accept any text/data\\\\nMany testers are aware that sometimes it is not easy to mediate between developers and testers or to find a common approach. \\\\nSometimes, anger also tends to rule on both sides. Within ISTQB this area is also described and some right points are mentioned. \\\\nFrom my experience, one should approach certain issues very carefully, build bridges and find common ground. To have an open ear for the problems, but also to recognize grievances in the processes early and to solve them. \\\\nWhat has always been clear over the years, however, is that the test department is only seen as an appendix to the development. How often in 20 years QA has heard the sentences \"Test, oh we\\\\\\'ll do that later\", \"We don\\\\\\'t need a test for that at all\". But what has also improved through the Scrum process is that the individual test is defined as part of the team, at least in this process. But tensions are also unavoidable. \\\\nI would be interested:\\\\n\\\\nHow do you avoid tensions in the processes?\\\\nHow can the testers be better integrated into the processes?\\\\nWhich psychological approach should be used if the tensions between testers and developers hinder existing processes? \\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m working with an automated script for multiple checkboxes that has dependent permissions.\\\\nGiven there are multiple checkboxes\\\\n\\\\nCheckbox A \\\\nCheckbox B \\\\nCheckbox C \\\\nCheckbox D \\\\nCheckbox E\\\\n\\\\nWhen I select Checkbox A\\\\nThen Checkbox C and Checkbox E is selected\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve handled this using a switch statement because there are multiple combinations but its kind of messy because certain checkbox(es) are not only selected but disabled as well due to the dependent permissions:\\\\ne.g.\\\\n    public boolean multipleCheckboxVerification(String roleName) {\\\\n    switch (roleName) {\\\\n        case CheckboxA:\\\\n            return permissionPage.isSelectedChkA() && permissionPage.isSelectedChkC()\\\\n                    && permissionPage.isSelectedChkE() && !permissionPage.isEnabledChkC() && !permissionPage.isEnabledChk();}\\\\n\\\\nMay I kindly know if there is a cleaner way to return which checkbox isn\\\\\\'t as expected?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m currently just using assertTrue from TestNG but the output seems to be vague of which checkbox is actually failing.\\\\nI was looking for an output where the error message would display \"Checkbox E is enabled where it should be disabled\"\\\\nI have 2 questions:\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the difference between Selenium builder and Katalon?

So somebody please clear me and how to select a tool ?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m using Selenium Webdriver (Java), Eclipse as IDE.\\\\nMy current setup was\\\\n\\\\nI have one Java project in Eclipse that serves as the framework (say FrameworkProject). The project is comprised of these packages, \\\\n\\\\ntestdata - holds testdata.java. This returns random test data for my tests like passwords, names etc...\\\\nutility - this package holds the object repository configuration class. This also contains the ExcelConfiguration class.\\\\npageObjects - this package holds the page object class of the current system under test (e.g Login.class, Register.class etc...)\\\\n\\\\nAnd the other java project was the TestProject. This only contains one package named tests. Under package tests, it has TestCase.class that serves as the testcase class, executes steps (I\\\\\\'m using page-object model by the way)\\\\n\\\\nNow, my questions are:\\\\n\\\\nIs it correct that I included the page objects in the first project (in the framework itself) ? Should it be in the TestProject ?\\\\nI did not declare my classes as abstract. What I just did was add the FrameworkProject as a JavaBuildPath to TestProject. Is it correct?\\\\nLastly, how about if there\\\\\\'s another project? Should I continue this kind of setup? Create another java project for the new project then add the framework as the javabuildpath? \\\\n\\\\nI am still new to this stuff. Every answer is much appreciated.\\\\nWhat are the available security testing tools for Android and iOS apps?\\\\nMainly for a passive scan for known vulnerabilities.\\\\nI applied for a job at google which is Test Analyst - I thought it would fit me due to the description of the job. Then I got a call and they are looking more of a software engineering in test. Now this brought me to a question to myself and my fellow QAs:\\\\n\\\\nWhat is Software Engineer in Test?\\\\nI am currently doing automation - selenium and C#. This may still mean I am not a software engineer? I may do coding but now I came to realize I am just automating the manual test cases. Are there other uses of automation aside from just automating the manual test cases or am I just not on the right track?\\\\n\\\\nHas anyone used RobotFramework to write automated browser tests and then used Blazemeters chrome plugin to record those tests and utilize Blazemeters performance test tools?  Is this even possible?\\\\nI\\\\\\'m looking for some advice on how to instantiate my WebDriver driver instance in my automation framework (Selenium 3.0.1 / Java 8 / TestNG).\\\\nMy goal is to handle all the instantiation code in one place, in my framework code, separated from my tests themselves, and then pass that instance around the framework.\\\\nIn Ruby, I would do something like this:\\\\n./framework/driver.rb\\\\ndef initialize\\\\n  $driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\\\\n\\\\n  # additional driver configuration\\\\nend\\\\n\\\\nThen I would include the framework classes in my base test class and call my driver from there.\\\\n./tests/utilities/base_test.rb\\\\n  def setup\\\\n    Driver.new\\\\n  end\\\\n\\\\nI would then have all my tests inherit from BaseTest.\\\\nIn Java, I am unfamiliar with how to achieve this with access modifiers and package structure.\\\\nSo far I have something like this (taken from Selenium HQ 1):\\\\n  public class Driver {\\\\n\\\\n  private static ChromeDriverService service;\\\\n  private WebDriver driver;\\\\n\\\\n  {@literal @BeforeClass}\\\\n  public static void createAndStartService() {\\\\n    service = new ChromeDriverService.Builder()\\\\n        .usingDriverExecutable(new File(\"path/to/my/chromedriver.exe\"))\\\\n        .usingAnyFreePort()\\\\n        .build();\\\\n    service.start();\\\\n  }\\\\n\\\\n  {@literal @AfterClass}\\\\n  public static void createAndStopService() {\\\\n    service.stop();\\\\n  }\\\\n\\\\n  {@literal @Before}\\\\n  public void createDriver() {\\\\n    driver = new RemoteWebDriver(service.getUrl(),\\\\n        DesiredCapabilities.chrome());\\\\n  }\\\\n\\\\n  {@literal @After}\\\\n  public void quitDriver() {\\\\n    driver.quit();\\\\n  }\\\\n\\\\n  public WebDriver getDriver() {\\\\n   return driver;\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nMy question is, how can I pass this driver instance around my framework (for example, I want my Page objects to be able to use it).  In Ruby, I triggered the creation of a global variable from my BaseTest.  In Java, I\\\\\\'ve added the getter to return the driver instance.  But this is problematic when I try to introduce TestNG annotations.  For example, I want to create/teardown a driver before/after every test.  I can get it to work, but is this best practice?  Is there a better way?\\\\nFor example, instead of using TestNG annotations to instantiate my driver, would it be better to use listeners?  I\\\\\\'ve also heard about Guice and dependency injection -- is this a useful design pattern?\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve seen a number of tutorials, blog posts, articles, etc., on this topic, but I can\\\\\\'t find what I\\\\\\'m after.  Again, my main goal here is to handle all my driver instantiation in one place in my framework in such a way that I can pass that same driver instance around.  It shouldn\\\\\\'t matter whether it\\\\\\'s a local ChromeDriver instance or a Remote WebDriver instance running on a grid.  I need it to be clean and scalable.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m getting an issue when try to automated user type on Redactor text editor.\\\\nHere\\\\\\'s the details:\\\\n\\\\nUsed command click or clickAt on Redactor text editor   \\\\nUsed Locator with ID, Name, or Class.\\\\nUsed command type and input the text\\\\nUsed command click on Save button\\\\n\\\\nAll of the test case was PASSED, but no text typed/appear on Redactor text editor after click on Save button, why is that?\\\\nI have created a script in virtual user generator, opened that script in controller and ran it. But the problem is that when I open Load Runner analysis for the results, it will display the error as below:\\\\n\\\\nI understand the concept of creating scripts to perform tasks, but I\\\\\\'ve read re-creating my manual tests as scripts isn\\\\\\'t the direction I should be headed. \\\\nWhat is the difference and what types of tasks should I be looking at to automate?\\\\nNote this was extracted from How can Manual QA\\\\\\'s without a programming background learn Automated Testing? which has 4 questions and thus is too broad.  I\\\\\\'m posting this from that as it seems like a good question.\\\\nFor someone who is new in automation, much of the discussion seems to be about scripts, functions and procedures in programming languages that developers use to write webdriver based programs that go through various web page workflows.\\\\nIf I am just getting into QA, what other tools and abilities will I need beside ability in these programming languages?\\\\nNote this question was extracted from How can Manual QA\\\\\\'s without a programming background learn Automated Testing? which had 4 questions within it, making it very hard to up/down vote a given answer.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m looking for ways to test my scripts and some patterns you use/recommend. For instance, how would you test a script such as this one:\\\\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\\\\nbuild=\"$1\"\\\\n\\\\n# check that build number is passed\\\\n[[ -z $build ]] && { echo \"missing argument: build\"; exit 1; }\\\\n\\\\ncd ./visual || exit 1\\\\n\\\\ncurl \"https://\" | grep -o \\\\\\'https://[^\"]*\\\\\\' > artifacts.txt\\\\n\\\\nawk -v TOKEN=\"$TOKEN\" \\\\\\'/current/ {print $0 \"?token=\" TOKEN;}\\\\\\' artifacts.txt \\\\\\\\\\\\n| xargs -P4 -l1 wget \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --content-disposition \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --force-directories \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --no-host-directories \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --cut-dirs=5\\\\n\\\\n# let\\\\\\'s remove our token from the filename\\\\nshopt -s globstar\\\\nfor file in **/*; do\\\\n  mv $file ${file/\\\\\\\\?*/}\\\\ndone\\\\n\\\\nrm artifacts.txt\\\\n\\\\nHow do I check I have been cd to the correct directory?\\\\nCurrently I stub cd to check how it\\\\\\'s call.\\\\n  cd() { echo \"cd $*\"; exit; }  # mock\\\\n  export -f cd\\\\n  run my-script.bash \"1234\"\\\\n\\\\n  [[ \"${lines[0]}\" == \"cd ./visual\" ]]\\\\n\\\\nBut then the script continue to run everything after that.\\\\nHow to test a pipe?\\\\ncurl \"https://\" | grep -o \\\\\\'https://[^\"]*\\\\\\' > artifacts.txt\\\\n\\\\nor\\\\nawk -v TOKEN=\"$TOKEN\" \\\\\\'/current/ {print $0 \"?token=\" TOKEN;}\\\\\\' artifacts.txt \\\\\\\\\\\\n| xargs -P4 -l1 wget \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --content-disposition \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --force-directories \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --no-host-directories \\\\\\\\\\\\n  --cut-dirs=5\\\\n\\\\nWhat would you test and how?

A tester writes a test case in a spreadsheet, with each test step and expected result. Then, another tester reviews the test case and approves it if its ok. The test writer then executes the test when needed.\\\\nThe problem with the above approach is that sometimes, the test reviewers approve tests even when the test steps are missing some crucial information. This omission was discovered only when a third person was asked to execute some tests. \\\\nSo, I was thinking of changing the process by making the reviewer execute the test. I believe that this might make the reviewer be more thorough because he has to execute the test, i.e. he cannot afford to miss important details. As an aside, the new way might bring out lack of documentation. When, reviewers find that system documentation is needed in order to run a test, then they will ask for it and mention it to our QA manager (during scrum meetings).\\\\nDoes the new approach make sense ?

I had the same code without Cucumber and my tests wait for the loader to disappear.\\\\nCan someone point me in the direction where the issue might be ?\\\\nWhat is the use of plus \"+\" symbol in code?\\\\nEg: (char) (myRandom.nextInt(26) **+** \\\\\\'A\\\\\\')\\\\nWe have a requirement for running multiple suites in parallel in our software testing services. \\\\nBelow are the 3 approaches that I have tried so far:\\\\n\\\\nAdded parallel_tests in Gemfile.\\\\nAdded \\\\\\'require parallel_tests\\\\\\' in rake file\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa8\\\\nCreated 02 nodes and also created a Grid Console for execution of both the nods in parallel\\\\n\\\\nResult: Only one node gets executed successfully instead of executing both of them in parallel.\\\\nConfigurations used are:\\\\nLanguage: Ruby 2.3\\\\nMac: 10.2.3 version\\\\nRpsec, rake file framework structure\\\\nUser should not be able to close the browser using following methods. \\\\n1)Clicking X button of browser window\\\\n2)Using Alt+F4 \\\\n3)Right-Click on Taskbar Icon + Close Window \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEdit : \\\\n\\\\nWe require this setup to run uninterrupted test on a machine that would be accessed by users and would have separate applications running at the same time of this test run. So we want to avoid our browser being messed around during that period. just want to run the tests in locked manner in a browser. User should be free to do anything else on that machine. \\\\nWhen executing the test suite, Ranorex runs the Program class. However, when running Code Modules individually in isolation, they appear to be executed directly.\\\\nI have code which I want to be executed in either case. But I cannot find a decent place to but it.\\\\nOne option is to have Code Modules inherit from a base class which executes such code. Thereby, the base class code will be executed when a code module is run in isolation and also when it is run from within the test suite. However, this appears unintuitive, as I hijack the inheritance concept in order to solve an execution-order problem.\\\\nI am Software Engineer in Test and I have been assigned to test the accessibility of a webpage. We already have manual QA\\\\\\'s for this and I would like to ask the following.\\\\n\\\\nWhat do I do as a S.E.T. in this topic?\\\\nAre there any frameworks that apply to this kind of testing?\\\\n\\\\nI have downloaded and imported Selenium 3.60 jars but unable to import packages:\\\\npackage basics;\\\\n\\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.By;\\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.Keys;\\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\\\\nimport org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;\\\\n\\\\n\\\\npublic class Synchronization {\\\\n\\\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\\\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\\\\n        System.setProperty(\"webdriver.gecko.driver\",\"N://drivers//geckodriver.exe\");\\\\n        WebDriver driver=new FirefoxDriver();\\\\n        //driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5,TimeUnit.SECONDS); //implicit wait\\\\n        driver.get(\"https://alaskatrips.poweredbygps.com/g/pt/hotels?MDPCID=ALASKA-US.TPS.BRAND.hotels.HOTEL\");\\\\n        driver.findElement(By.id(\"H-destination\")).sendKeys(\"nyc\");\\\\n        driver.findElement(By.id(\"H-destination\")).sendKeys(Keys.TAB); //tab operation\\\\n        driver.findElement(By.id(\"H-fromDate\")).sendKeys(Keys.ENTER); \\\\n\\\\n        WebDriverwait d=new Webriverwait(5,driver);\\\\n\\\\n        driver.findElement(By.xpath(\".//a[contains(@href,\\\\\\'North-Bergen-Hotels-Howard-Johnson\\\\\\')]\")).click();\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve been using Selenium for awhile and I know many testers have compiled lists of standard security compliance types of tests to perform, like are listed here\\\\nThese fall into a list of tests that are performed on every web site for basic security compliance, a short list here:\\\\n\\\\nForm Fields: Visible and Hidden  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEscape codes  \\\\nSQL Injections  \\\\nNon-ascii, Unicode vs UTF-8  \\\\n\\\\nURLs  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQuery String Manipulations\\\\n\\\\n\\\\netc.\\\\nQuestion: Since these tests are commonly repeated and fairly generic, has anyone compiled a list of Tests created with Selenium that target these well known security compliance related issues?\\\\nSome granular extensions based on common security compliance checks like this:  \\\\npublic static class WebDriverComplianceExtensions\\\\n{\\\\n    public static void InputOneSixty(this IWebDriver driver, By by)\\\\n    {\\\\n        var input = driver.WaitUntil(d => d.FindElement(by));\\\\n        input.SendKeys(\"&#160;\");\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nAnd hopefully some sort of intelligent extensions like:\\\\nIWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\\\\n// some page navigation...\\\\nAssert.IsTrue(driver.PerformComplianceCheck(By.Id(\"FirstNameInputBox\")));\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m coming from a Java+Selenium environment, so maybe this is a mismatch of understanding that I\\\\\\'m having with Javascript/Angular/Protractor.  I used to use IntelliJ\\\\\\'s IDEA IDE for automation testing. I could actively do live search and on the fly testing of ideas using IDEA\\\\\\'s Evaluate Expression functionality.  I could actively look for elements on a page (searching using CSS selectors for instance) and do a click (or see what the text is), and if my test was in debug mode it would do the click on the page. \\\\nI was really hoping for a similar experience with WebStorm since it\\\\\\'s IntelliJ\\\\\\'s answer for Javascript development. I\\\\\\'m in the middle of debugging a Protractor UI test and I can\\\\\\'t look at the result of a getText() without doing a .then() clause and a console.log in the .then() clause.  I feel like if I do element.getText() in the Evaluate Expression tool I should be able to see what that Promise will evaluate to without having to do a then clause that resolves the Promise. I understand there\\\\\\'s stuff having to do with the asynchronous nature of Javascript that requires the resolution of the Promise, but I would think this super smart IDE would have resolution stuff built in. Is there a way to setup WebStorm to say \\\\\\'hey, resolve this for me and let me see what happens!\"? I would hope for getting the same behavior when I evaluate element.click().\\\\nWe need to consolidate Test cases across all projects.We have an idea of using Synchronizer.I am totally new to it.

I am trying to click a popup menu that appears upon clicking an image (arrow). The problem is once I click the arrow, the popup menu does not exist anywhere that I can find. I cannot inspect its element either. It crashes the \"inspect element\" in IE (page must load in IE) and a using a third party extension DebugBar also does nothing.\\\\nWhats happening is that in some cases when I select the popup link it opens in a new frame on the same page. The javascript changes everything for the new frame. When it instead uses a new URL (pop up window) I won\\\\\\'t have problems navigating. Only when I need the new frame to appear so that I can get the new elments on the page.\\\\n\\\\nI am wondering if anyone have any ideas I could try. \\\\nTo click the arrow I have to navigate the DOM using an Xpath as the id does not exist. (the \"import\" icon is a button separate from the arrow) Maybe there is something I can do with calling javascript in the source?\\\\nI know the target in many places is the UCF_Mainframe. Just most of the changes happen in the javascript (which I can view all the functions by viewing source). What I believe is happening is the popup is all javascript rendered so its probably just an onclick event.\\\\nThe main body:\\\\n<TD id=import title=\"Import\" class=clsHeaderItem selectedImg=\"x\" unselectedImg=\"null\" targetArgument=\"\" target=\"UCF_X\" url=\"\" dataFrame=\"null\" popUp=\"0\">\\\\n\\\\n<TABLE style=\"TABLE-LAYOUT: fixed\" cellSpacing=0 width=\"100%\" cellpading=\"0\">\\\\n<TBODY>\\\\n<TR>\\\\n<TD class=\"BorderTop BorderBottom BorderLeft\" height=55 width=\"100%\" align=center>\\\\n<DIV><SPAN id=0>Import</SPAN></DIV>\\\\n<DIV align=center valign=\"middle\">\\\\n<DIV style=\"PADDING-BOTTOM: 2px; PADDING-TOP: 2px\"><IMG id=0 src=\"x\"><IMG id=0 src=\"xx\">\\\\n\\\\n<IMG id=1 src=\"x3\"> <---Arrow Element Here\\\\n\\\\n</DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD>\\\\n\\\\nThe problem I saw with creating a action builder was that it doesn\\\\\\'t behave exactly like a mouse cursor so when you hover over the area it doesn\\\\\\'t see it because there are no elements being hovered over it.

I can\\\\\\'t even computer...\\\\nWhy does this happen?\\\\nEdit: Originally, when I closed the first window, I was getting another error, but upgrading to the latest Selenium (2.45.0) fixed that problem.\\\\nIm not sure why, but ever time my screenshot is executed, the images are saved as blank.\\\\nheres the code:\\\\n    public void screenshotOnError() throws IOException {\\\\n    WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();\\\\n\\\\n    long epoch = System.currentTimeMillis();\\\\n    String ssTimestamp = String.valueOf(epoch);\\\\n\\\\n    File scrFile = ((TakesScreenshot) driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);\\\\n    FileUtils.copyFile(scrFile, new File(\"/Users/sqadan/Desktop/workFiles/maven/MavenProject/screenshots/\" + ssTimestamp + \".jpg\"));\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\\\'s the code that\\\\\\'s calling this method:\\\\n    @Test\\\\n    public websiteProspector_beta doLogin(String myUsername, String myPassword) throws IOException {\\\\n    logs.InfoDetails(\"Logging into Tomcat8- 2092\");\\\\n\\\\n    try {\\\\n        username.sendKeys(myUsername);\\\\n        password.sendKeys(myPassword);\\\\n        loginButton.click();\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        Assert.assertEquals(driver.getPageSource().contains(cF.homePage), true);\\\\n        logs.InfoDetails(\"Login successful\");\\\\n    }catch (NoSuchElementException e) {\\\\n        logs.errorDetails(\"Login unsuccessful\");\\\\n        tU.screenshotOnError();\\\\n\\\\nCan anybody help me out of getting tool tip from a  tag which is the object location where there is no title or any other attributes that contain the tool tip value.\\\\nMy object location is present in the below tag:\\\\n<rect style=\"cursor: pointer; stroke: rgb(192, 192, 192); stroke-opacity: 0.000001; fill-opacity: 0.000001; fill: rgb(192, 192, 192);\" x=\"634.5\" y=\"46.5\" width=\"50\" height=\"130\" rx=\"1\" ry=\"1\" stroke=\"#c0c0c0\" stroke-opacity=\"0.000001\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill-opacity=\"0.000001\" fill=\"#c0c0c0\">\\\\nBut the tool tip value is \"Standard, DLOB, 16,545,429\"\\\\nWe\\\\\\'re using Jenkins to run tests against DB over TLS. For that JDK on Jenkins node requires DB certificate to be installed in the keystore.\\\\nWe have added certificate to JDK keystore and it worked fine until we upgraded minor version of JDK (from 1.8.11 to 1.8.45). It looks like every time we upgrade JDK, keystore is refreshed. Is there a way to avoid reinstalling certificates every time we upgrade JDK?\\\\nI am using selenium webdriver with python. I am not able to find a way in python by which I can switch the webdriver to a new browser.\\\\nMy web application have  multiple links and buttons\\\\nClicking on any of  them leads to a new browser window being opened.  \\\\nfor clicking on buttons and link I have used below code \\\\ndriver.find_element_by_css_selector(\"input[type=\\\\\\\\\"submit\\\\\\\\\"]\").click()\\\\ndriver.find_element_by_id(\"btn1\").click()\\\\ndriver.find_element_by_css_selector(\"#linksPlace > #OIT> a\").click()\\\\n\\\\nFor selecting subsequent browser windows, I have used below code\\\\nfor handle in driver.window_handles:\\\\n    print handle\\\\n    driver.switch_to_window(handle)\\\\n    driver.get_window_position(handle)\\\\n    driver.save_screenshot(\\\\\\'E:\\\\\\\\Selenium scripts\\\\\\\\demo.png\\\\\\')\\\\n\\\\nHowever  I am not able to navigate to that new browser window. I have used below command as well, but things didn\\\\\\'t work\\\\n     driver.switch_to_window(driver.window_handles[-1])\\\\n\\\\nIs there any way by which I can navigate to new browser window?\\\\nI have seen that there are functions which exist in java and c# to do the same, but struggled so far in python.\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve seen the term \"fixture\" used in a number of different contexts, and I suspect I don\\\\\\'t quite understand what is meant by the term, because I see it used to mean things that I didn\\\\\\'t think it meant. At a high level, can someone provide a clear, concise definition of the term?\\\\nI know the default answer to handling explorer.exe is to use AutoIT, but AutoIT utilizes Java Runtime to use the exported .exe to upload the file and close the dialog. My tests are all in Protractor since this is an AngularJS app.\\\\nThe selectFile function is:\\\\nselectFile: function(image) {\\\\n  var path = require(\\\\\\'path\\\\\\');\\\\n  var image_path = path.resolve(__dirname, image);\\\\n\\\\n  this.uploadButton.click();\\\\n  this.uploadButton.sendKeys(image_path);\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve run my full suite of tests in Chrome, Firefox, and IE11. Chrome and Firefox just leave the file upload window open and carry on their tests in the background. IE absolutely will not continue after clicking the upload button. The dialog box must be dealt with somehow, but my test can\\\\\\'t even get to this.uploadButton.sendKeys(image_path); with that window open.\\\\nIs there a way to kill that File Upload box via Javascript, whether it be by process id or something else?\\\\n\\\\nMore detailed info on my attempts at getting around this are on my Stack Overflow question from before I knew this site existed. Since you all are more specialized, perhaps I can get more / different answers here, too.\\\\nI am helping my friend with some medical records verification. In short, I have to through hundreds of medical records and pinpoint certain ones for verification. I want to be able to search through these hundreds of records. The problems is that the medical records can only be viewed in a protected and private HTML document, which means I cannot extract them to a pdf. I believe that the documents are in from a asp.net database.\\\\nMy best hope is to literally have my computer take a picture of the entire webpage. The computer screenshots, scrolls down, screenshots, scrolls down, screenshots .... etc. Does anyone know any program that will automate this iterative process. Once I have a pdf, I can easily parse it into searchable text. \\\\nAny help is appreciated. \\\\n\\'']\n"]}],"source":["#from google.colab import files\n","\n","#f1 = files.upload()

than default time to load the result page check if all the search parameters are used to fetch data shown on the result grid the total number of results should be displayed in the result grid search criteria used for searching should be displayed in the result grid result grid values should be sorted by default column sorted columns should be displayed with a sort icon result grids should include all the specified columns with correct values ascending and descending sorting functionality should work for columns supported by data sorting result grids should be displayed with proper column and row spacing pagination should be enabled when there are more results than the default result count per page check for next previous first and last page pagination functionality duplicate records should not be displayed in the result grid check if all the columns are visible and a horizontal scrollbar is enabled if necessary check the data for dynamic columns columns whose values are calculated dynamically based on the other column values for result grids showing reports check totals row and verify the total for every column for result grids showing reports check totals row data when pagination is enabled and the user gets navigated to the next page symbol should be displayed for percentage calculation check result grid data to know if the date range is enabled test scenarios for a window check if the default window size is correct check if the child window size is correct check if there is any field on the page with default focus in general the focus should be set on the first input field of the screen check if child windows are getting closed on closing window if the child window is opened the user should not be able to use or update any field in the background or parent window check window minimize maximize and close functionality check if the window is check scroll bar functionality for parent and child windows check cancel button functionality for the child window database testing test scenarios check if correct data is getting saved in the database upon a successful page submit check values for columns that are not accepting null values data should be stored in single or multiple tables based on the design tablename columnname tables should have a primary key column table columns should have description information available except for audit columns like created date created by etc for every database operation log should be added required table indexes should be created check if data is committed to the database only when the operation is successfully completed data should be rolled back in case of failed transactions test uat sandbox live though this is not a standard it is helpful for database maintenance database logical names should be given according to the database name again this is not standard but helpful for db maintenance stored procedures should not be named with a prefix check if values for table audit columns like created date created by updated updated by is deleted deleted data deleted by etc are populated properly field length shown to the user on the page and in database schema should be the same check numeric fields with minimum maximum and float values check numeric fields with negative values for both acceptance and check if the radio button and list options are saved correctly in the database check if the database fields are designed with the correct data type and data length are implemented correctly test stored procedures and triggers with sample input data input field leading and trailing spaces should be truncated before committing data to the database null values should not be allowed for the primary key column test scenarios for image upload functionality check for uploaded image path check image upload and change functionality check image upload functionality with image files of different extensions for example jpeg png bmp etc check image upload functionality with images having space or any other allowed special character in the file name check duplicate name image upload the proper error message should be displayed a proper error message should be displayed

functionality using to cc and bcc fields check plain text emails check html format emails check email header and footer for company logo privacy policy and other links check emails with attachments check to send email functionality to single multiple or distribution list recipients check if a reply to the email address is correct check to send the high volume of emails test scenarios for excel export functionality the file should get exported in the proper file extension the file name for the exported excel file should be as per the standards for example if the file name is using the timestamp it should get replaced properly with an actual timestamp at the time of exporting the file check for date format if exported excel file contains the date columns formatting should be the same as shown on the page the exported file should have columns with proper column names default page sorting should be carried in the exported file as well values for all pages check if the data displayed on a page and exported excel file is the same check export functionality when pagination is enabled check if the export button is showing proper icon according to the exported file type for example excel file icon for xls files check export functionality for files with very large size check if these special characters are exported properly in the excel file performance testing test scenarios check if the page load time is within the acceptable range check the page load on slow connections check the response time for any action under a light normal moderate and heavy load conditions check the performance of database stored procedures and triggers check the database query execution time check for load testing of the application check for the stress testing of the application check cpu and memory usage under peak load conditions security testing test scenarios check for sql injection attacks secure pages should use the https protocol the error page should be displayed for this escape special characters in the input error messages should not reveal any sensitive information all credentials should be transferred over an encrypted channel test password security and password policy enforcement check application logout functionality check for brute force attacks cookie information should be stored in encrypted format only check session cookie duration and session termination after timeout or logout session tokens should be transmitted over a secured channel the password should not be stored in cookies test for denial of service attacks test for memory leakage test unauthorized application access by manipulating variable values in the browser address bar test file extension handing so that exe files are not uploaded and executed on the server sensitive fields like passwords and credit card information should not have to autocomplete enabled file upload functionality should use file type restrictions and also for scanning uploaded files check if directory listing is prohibited passwords and other sensitive fields should be masked while typing check if forgot password functionality is secured with features like temporary password expiry after specified hours and security question is asked before changing or requesting a new password verify captcha functionality check if important events are logged in log files check if access privileges are implemented correctly api testing test cases environment to be production response should be okay to process response must be valid and have a body\n","<FreqDist with 550 samples and
