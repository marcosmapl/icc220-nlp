b'I am getting:\n\nType mismatch: cannot convert from org.openqa.selenium.WebElement to WebElement\n\nfor the below code:\nimport org.openqa.selenium.*;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;\n\npublic class WebElement {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();\n        driver.manage().window().maximize();\n\n        driver.get("https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F&service=mail&sacu=1&rip=1&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin");\n\n        WebElement emailField = driver.findElement(By.id("identifierId"));\n\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWhat should I test if I have created a scenario with Python (bottle + mako) and web front-end to download a PDF file for registered users? I can use selenium to start Firefox, login and trigger the PDF file download, and then (theoretically, I didn\'t try it) I can use a tool like textract to extract to text from the PDF file and inspect that it has the expected text and not an error message. \nHowever the nature of my use case is that the file won\'t download at all if something is wrong and I\'m rendering HTML onto a PDF using the python tool pdfkit:\nimport pdfkit\nto_pdf_file = \'/tmp/output.pdf\'\nfrom bottle import static_file\ncss = \'/srv/http/python.dev/python-common/assets/static_files/css/styles.css\'\npdfkit.from_string(render_template("oncall/dayview_reload", values), to_pdf_file, css=css)\nreturn static_file(\'output.pdf\', root=\'/tmp\', download=\'output.pdf\')\n\nSo it feels rather pointless to test the PDF instead of testing the HTML because in practice I would only test that the third-party library pdfkit is working on, not testing my code. \nI feel that I might as well test only the HTML that it renders and prints the correct result, or would it be important to actually test that the PDF is generated and prints the correct data?\nOr should I use some other approach to make my test "right" ?\nMy test code looks like the following right now, it starts selenium and makes the download, but I feel that I might as well test only the HTML instead of the PDF. \nclass ViewTest(unittest.TestCase):\n@classmethod\ndef setUp(cls):\n    cls.driver = webdriver.Firefox()\n    cls.driver.implicitly_wait(20)\n    cls.driver.maximize_window()\n    cls.driver.get("http://python.dev/oncall/daily_reload?oncall_customer_ids=417&oncall_customer_id=417")\n\n\ndef test_1(self):\n\n    username_input = self.driver.find_element_by_name("email")\n    username_input.send_keys(\'kerstin@example.se\')\n    password_input = self.driver.find_element_by_name("password")\n    password_input.send_keys(\'ex4mple1\')\n    self.driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\'.btn.btn-primary.btn-block.btn-lg\').click()\n\n    print("done")\n\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: The path to the driver executable must be set by the webdriver.chrome.driver system property; for more information, see https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver.

I have not used automated testing at all before, so am still getting to grips with it. \nThe framework that I have decided to use is Protractor, and I\'m just looking at starting to write some basic tests, however, I\'m having a bit of trouble getting hold of some of the HTML elements from within the spec.js file where my tests will be written. I have the following describe block in spec.js:\ndescribe(\'My App\', function() {\n    var loginForm = element(by.id(\'loginForm\'));\n    var loginBtn = element(by.className(\'form-control\'));\n    var usernameInputField = element(by.id(\'inputName\'));\n    var passwordInputField = element(by.id(\'inputPass\'));\n\n    it(\'should hit the VM hosted site\', function() {\n        browser.get(\'http://192.168.x.xyz:8080);\n        expect(browser.getTitle()).toEqual(\'My app\');\n    });\n\n    //Test to log in:\n    it(\'should enter the username into the username field on log in form\', function() {\n        usernameInputField.sendKeys(\'username\');\n        passwordInputField.sendKeys(\'password\');\n    });\n});\n\nMy conf.js file currently looks like this:\nexports.config = {\n    framework: \'jasmine\',\n    seleniumAddress: \'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\',\n    specs: [\'spec.js\'],\n    multiCapabilities: {\n        browserName: \'firefox\'\n    }\n}\n\nWhen I run the command protractor conf.js from the command line, I get some output that says:\n\nFailed: No element found using locator: By(css selector, "[id="inputName"])\n\nI have \'inspected\' the input field for the username on the form in the browser, and it shows that the HTML element\'s \'name\' attribute is \'inputName\'.\nI don\'t understand why the console is giving me the error that says it\'s trying to find the element using a \'CSS selector\'- I\'m expecting it to try and find the element by it\'s HTML tag\'s \'name\' attribute... Clearly I\'m doing something wrong in how I\'m writing the \'test to log in\', because if I comment that out, and run protractor conf.js again, I get 0 failures- so the other test is running successfully...\nWhat am I doing wrong here? How can I get the form input fields and enter correct log in details into them to check that the \'log in\' feature works correctly?\nAs an aside, although I will want to test the \'log in\' capability too, is there  a way to \'skip\' this during testing, so that I can run the tests on all of the features of the app, without Protractor having to log in to the app every time to run the tests?\nEdit\nI\'ve done what was suggested by @KatePaulk in their answer, and my test now looks like this:\nvar usernameInputField = element(by.name(\'inputName\'));\nvar passwordInputField = element(by.name(\'inputPass\'));\n...\nfunction loginAsUser(username, password) {\n    username = "abc";\n    password = "xyz";\n    usernameInputField.sendKeys(username);\n    passwordInputField.sendKeys(password);\n\n    loginBtn.click();\n}\n\nit(\'should log the user in to app\', function() {\n    loginAsUser(username, password);\n});\n\nand while the script is running, although the username & password fields are correctly populated on the log in form, I get an error message when the script is trying to press the \'Log In\' button, to submit the form:\n\nW/element - more than one element found for locator By(css selector, .form-control) = the first result will be used\n\nIf I continue the script after this, the browser window is closed, and the script exits.\nWhat am I doing wrong with how I am retrieving & clicking the \'log in\' button?\nEdit\nAs requested, the HTML for the form is:\n<div class="page-signin">\n  <div class="signin-header">\n    <section class="logo text-center">\n      <h1>Login to {{main.brand}}</h1>\n    </section>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class="signin-body">\n    <div class="container">\n      <div class="form-container" data-ng-controller="LoginCtrl">\n        <div ng-show="errors.general || errors.username || errors.password"\n             class="alert alert-danger">\n            {{errors.general || errors.username || errors.password}}\n        </div>\n        <form class="form-horizontal"\n              data-ng-submit="login()"\n              name="loginForm">\n          <fieldset>\n            <div class="form-group">\n              <div class="input-group input-group-first">\n                <span class="input-group-addon"\n                      ng-class="{\'login-error-icon\': errors.username}">\n                  <span class="ti-user"></span>\n                </span>\n                <input type="text" um-autofocus\n                   class="form-control input-lg"\n                   data-ng-model="user.username"\n                   placeholder="Username"\n                   autocapitalize="off"\n                   name="inputName">\n             </div>\n           </div>\n            <div class="form-group">\n              <div class="input-group">\n                <span class="input-group-addon"\n                      ng-class="{\'login-error-icon\': errors.password}">\n                  <span class="ti-lock"></span>\n                </span>\n                <input type="password"\n                   class="form-control input-lg"\n                   data-ng-model="user.password"\n                   placeholder="Password"\n                   name="inputPass">\n              </div>\n           </div>\n            <div class="form-group">\n                <div class="input-group login-checkbox">\n                    <span class="input-group-addon">\n                        <label class="ui-checkbox">\n                            <input data-ng-model="persistent" type="checkbox"/>\n                            <span></span>\n                        </label>\n                    </span>\n                    <label class="form-control input-lg">\n                        <input data-ng-model="persistent" type="checkbox"/>\n                        <span>Remember me</span>\n                    </label>\n                </div>\n           </div>\n           <div class="divider divider-sm"></div>\n           <div class="form-control">\n              <input type="submit"\n                 class="btn btn-brand text-center pull-right"\n                 value="Log in"/>\n          </div>\n          </fieldset>\n        </form>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nI am creating a simple webapp that allows my support colleagues to run Selenium Java Code from my custom created API.\nWhen from Eclipse (the app deployed in Tomcat8) I run a script, i can see in my screen that the webbrowser (in this case the chrome webdriver) is opened and I can actually see what is happening in my screen. However, when I just start Tomcat as a windows service (and do not run it from Eclipse), it also run, however it seems to run headless. I would like it to also show me the browser so that I can see what is happening. I can\'t really find anything on this, so I hope someone can help me out here or give me a pointer.\nWorking in an inherited automation codebase.  There is a method which waits to see if jQuery has been initialized.  \n.until(new Function<WebDriver, Boolean>() {\n                    @Override\n                    public Boolean apply(WebDriver webDriver) {\n                        boolean go = (Long) runJavaScript("return jQuery.active") == 0;\n                        if (!go) {\n                            LOGGER.debug("stalling");\n                        }\n                        return go;\n                    }\n\nRan into an issue with jQuery not being defined.  I added a check to see if jQuery is defined and refactored the code to use a lambda expression \n.until((Function<WebDriver, Boolean>) webDriver -> {\n                    boolean go = (Boolean) runJavaScript("return !!window.jQuery && jQuery.active == 0");\n                    if(!go){\n                        LOGGER.debug("stalling");\n                    }\n                    return go;\n                });\n\nMy question pertains to the casting of the return of runJavaScript which is just a custom wrapper of JavaScriptExecutor\'s executeScript method.  Initially it was built to return jQuery.active cast it to a Long and compare it to zero.  I refactored it to cast the return of jQuery.active == 0 to a boolean.   Is there any value to cast to a Long over a boolean in this case? \nI am writing the registration script where the API is being called in company registration no field and it fetches all the data regarding company and fill it automatically in according field like name, phone no, address etc. So i want to make the script wait until all text-fields are filled with values.

It was a pretty handy tool, but the site now seems to be defunct - upgrading past the free trial is broken and nobody seems to be answering support questions. Before I go back to copy and paste with a spreadsheet, I thought I\'d check to see if anybody here knows of a similar web-based tool that is actually maintained.\nIt doesn\'t necessarily have to have every feature that Test Run did, but the ability to write test scripts, assign them to different users, and create one-off test plans from existing tests are pretty key.\nI want to do performance testing in linux environment for a C++ application. I need to measure the CPU usage, Memory usage of the application. This application is a multi threaded application.\nIn this requirement I came across two Tools/Utilities (sar and top). My problem now is if I want to monitor cpu usage by user I can use top utility for this but not sure if this is available in sar utility. If I am wrong on my approach please direct me to the correct path on how to do performance testing in linux environment.\nAs a end note I use putty to login to the remote linux machine thus any GUI based tool will not help me.\nAny help will be of great use to me.\nThere must be many questions like this on the site but I have some unique requirements that affect my choice of test management / QA process management system. This is for managing the test cases and recording results, not for performing the actual tests, which will be done manually and with other automation tools.\n\nWe\'re building tests for a website that has at least a few changes in behaviour every day. So if there are 1,000 tests, at least 5 will definitely break every day because of a new feature or design change. I mention it because I don\'t want to use something that assumes once a test case is defined it will never change or changing it requires a formal review process.\nI want to write a test case 1 time, then record many variations of the same result. One for each device type, browser, OS, variations in other. For example, the "User Sign Up" main test case is defined once, then the result recorded every day for each browser/device/OS combo.\nI\'d like it to be web-based. Also with some kind of API to let our automated test tools (which mainly use Selenium) to post-test results as they happen).\n\nAll,\nDuring an interview with an major MNC , I was asked this curious question of " What is meant by pesticide paradox ? " I have been working as Test Engineer for almost 4 Years but I have never came across this terminology.\nCan some one help me with a real time example ?\nI\'m looking for a way to reuse User Defined Variables and Uses of said variables in a way that doesn\'t require repeating them in every JMeter test, I fear this isn\'t possible.\nFor example we\'ve defined a few User Defined Variables (with

Can anyone point me to something relatively recent?\nThanks\nWe\'re using the Performance Plugin running JMeter tests in Jenkins.  I\'m looking for some way to change the status and/or notify when tests run slower.  Is there another plugin I could use?  Any ideas how to proceed with modifying or writing my own Jenkins plugin if none provide the functionality I\'m looking for?\nI\'m a new QA tester in a company in an Agile environment. During the sprint commit I was told that one of my tasks was going to be testing user stories. How exactly do you test something like that? If anyone can give me any insight into this it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. \nI was recently promoted to QA lead on an agile team working with offshore testers and an onshore development team.\nWhat kind of things should I expect?\nAny helpful tips for how to be awesome at this?\nI was selected due to my soft skills not necessarily because I\'m an experienced QA. Needless to say I\'m a little confused on what kind of things I should be doing to ensure I do a great job.\nAny resources out there that will be helpful?\nI\'m currently one of a group of developers developing tests for a web-based line of products. These products are separate but related, and are periodically released (ie versioned). \nWe are trying to make our tests all "run from the head" against all different versions, meaning that the current state of our master test code branch can run meaningfully against arbitrary versions of the production builds. At first, this seems a bit intimidating, particularly since our tests are generally UI (Selenium) based, and hence, quite dependent on particular versions. \nAny tips for making this process easier? Or at least, more doable?  \nI am trying to re-purpose a QTP Shared Object Repository to be used in a different context, by exporting it to XML and processing the XML with an XML parser. So far, so good. The XML schema is simple and most of the data I need is there: HTML input field IDs and names, type of field, and the page of the application and the URL associated with that page.\nThe problem is, I also need to know what the full contents of the WebList (Combo Box) and WebRadioGroup values were at the time that the Shared Object Repository was created.\nI realize that Combo Boxes in HTML forms have both a value displayed to the user, and a value submitted as part of the HTML form, and the two values are not necessarily equivalent. That is fine. What we need for testing is the value contained within the HTML form -- the value that\'s sent with an HTTP Request in the Body. The value that\'s displayed to the user in the GUI is not relevant to our needs.\nAlso, when there are multiple radio buttons in a group, HTML will encode the value with a developer-defined value depending on which button is selected. For example, they could assign value "A" to radio button 1, value "B" to radio button 2, and value "C" to radio button 3, and then if you try to get the value of the radio button group in the HTML, it will return the value of the button that has been clicked by the user.\nI need to get those possible values into the Shared Object Repository, so that we can later process the Shared Object Repository\'s exported XML and re-use that data.\nSo my questions, which are closely related, are:\n\nCan the Shared Object Repository native format contain this data at all? Is it supported?\nCan the Shared Object Repository\'s XML-exported format contain this data? Will the format hold it?\nCan any built-in or custom QTP scripts generate a Shared Object Repository containing this data automatically while recording a path through the application?\n\nI have a VBA script which i want to run in the post processing section of the QC 11 Excel Reports generator (using the UI, not the API). This script uses the Dictionary object in the Microsoft.Scripting reference. When designing it in Excel, i add the reference via Tools->References. \nHow can this be achieved in QC?\nIN HP QC 10, I\'m looking to find all tests that have not had their design steps altered in the last 6 months.   Having trouble finding the correct table and query to do this.....\nThanks,\nI am currently working on a project that requires automating tests on a content player,\nI am using sikuli for it.\nThe problem is that we have piled up a large amount of screenshots which is becoming difficult to manage day by day.Size of image folder is becoming larger day by day. we want to reuse the older images as much as possible, but finding similar images is what has become a headache.\nIs there a tool which could find similar screenshots from a folder? is there any strategy we could use further to manage it ?\nTo explain better, if test B depends on test A, then\n\nif test A fails, then test B should not be run and fail implicitly\nif test A produces some output, then it should be available for test B\n\nI can see why this would be bad for Unit Tests, which should run in isolation, but I was thinking about System Tests where these are common unavoidable scenarios, and it would possibly be a better alternative to long tests which require many steps. I am thinking of something that works like a build file or Ant (where targets play the role of tests).\nIs this a terrible idea? If yes, are there testing frameworks that support this test style? If not, what problems am I overlooking?\nI am currently testing a piece of vehicle management software. To kill two birds with one stone I am also going to create a user guide, alongside a similar document to point out and describe bugs. \nThe document would need to be in a PDF format and would be screenshot heavy.\nIf anybody has done anything similar could you advise a piece of software fit for this job? I.E PDF creation, snipping tool?\nI am trying to avoid word at all costs.\nI\'ve received a job offer recently with a significant portion of the pay based on yet to be determined "objective" performance metrics. We are supposed to sit down together after I\'ve worked there awhile to develop and agree on the metrics that will be used. The only metric suggested by the employer so far is the number of bugs in released code. \nIs this workable? Is it a fair metric or, as I fear, will it introduce dysfunction? Are there other metrics that could/should be used? Some of the issues that concern me are defining what a bug is, who finds the bug (does it only count when the customer finds it?), how do bugs found in old releases count, does a bug caused by a requirements gap count, what happens when other people whose pay is not effected by this metric, such as developers, help out with testing before a big release, what about the conflict between finding all the bugs and getting the product shipped, etc. \nIn other words, are there reasonable performance metrics that could be used? \nTo record scripts in JMeter we need to run the proxy on local port 8080, where as in browser I need to configure for internet connectivity proxy to connect to internet.\nThe company I work for is providing me internet through a proxy server.\n\nAnyone who knows how to record script using Jmeter while there is already internet proxy set up in the browser to connect to internet?\n\nI\'ve been trying to hire a tester for a few months without success. I really want to find someone who is both a tester and a developer, not because I want them to do two roles, but because the kind of testing I want them to do is all about automation and therefore I think they need to be able to at least programme in a scripting language like python to a reasonable level. Agencies tell me that it\'s not realistic to aim to find such a person, and I think their reasoning is something like: a good developer would rather be a developer than a tester (more money, more prestige).\nSo, my question is: is it realistic to try to find a developer turned tester or a tester who has learned to develop testing code? If not, what\'s a good alternative approach?\nEdit: Great answers, guys. Thanks so much: this has been genuinely helpful. If anyone here is interested in a test automation development role based in London, let me know!\nWe have a need to verify content on our site using Selenium IDE; specifically for this question Youtube video served up in an iframe:\n{<iframe width="506" height="315" frameborder="0" class="player" id="player" allowfullscreen="1" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9l1WYPhs0cc?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fxxx.com"></iframe>}\n\n(origin xed out...)\nI have tried to use Selenium to click on the video - no result, and running through a list I knew a video was not available - it went right through it, so that doesn\'t work for verification.  I settled down to a storeEval statement and attempted to do the getElementById javascript statement, but that really can\'t find the element that is loaded by the iframe.\nAnybody had to verify Youtube content?\nI\'ve read that if a requirement can\'t be verified by black-box testing or inspection, then it\'s not a requirement, but a design specification.\nI\'m building a software that makes processing with on images acquired by a camera, and the processing itself should be verified because it is essential for producing the right image presented to the end user. \nHowever it is very difficult to test this in black-box, even in gray-box, so I wonder if it should be listed as a software requirement? If yes, then is it OK for my software verification to have it verified in white or gray-box testing?\n\nPS: I\'m building medical device software, thus following IEC 62304 standard, that specifies that my software requirements shall be verified through system testing.\nI am working at a small in-house dev department in a non-IT organisation. Me and another junior dev are creating a mid-sized CRUD web application in ASP MVC. There is no formal test process in our department. I am trying to gently introduce some best practices including unit testing, of which I only have theoretical knowledge myself. \nWe started with creating a nice, clean database schema. During the requirements analysis and database modelling phases, I went through piles of real data from our domain and then entered them all per hand in the database. Then the other dev got the task of creating the Model part of the project, writing the entity and repository classes needed for Linq to SQL. \nI outlined my vision for the unit tests of his classes: We already have a small but consistent set of data we can use as a test data. I suggested that he automatically recreate the database from scratch, filling the tables per SQL script, and then let the tests run against the dataset. He agreed and went to work. \nNow, a few weeks later, he has for some reason decided that he doesn\'t like working with the data as it is. He initializes the database by re-creating the schema, and then fills it using our Linq classes and their connections. He does not pay attention to keeping the data in a state which is sensible for the domain. Example: in my data, a mouse could have a mutation expressed in the mammary glands. In his data, a drosophila can have a mutation expressed in the mamary glands, because he just set random connections between records from the proper tables, without caring for business meaning. \nI see two problems with this approach. \n\nI think that the tests supposed to verify the work of our Linq classes should not use the Linq classes for initialization of the data set. From my point of view, this is a bad case of circular reasoning. \nI would like to keep one set of test data which is applicable for most types of test, maybe with a few necessary variations. While there is no reason why the data used for unit testing the database connection should be the same as the data used for tests involving the users, there is also no reason to make it different. And the users cannot work with data which tells them that a drosophila has mammary glands. So, I would like us to adapt our tests to work with the old data set. \n\nMy co-worker is unhappy, because my suggestions mean extra work load. He feels that they are completely unnecessary. \nMy questions for you: First, is his approach wrong (so we should change it), or is it right (maybe one of many possible right approaches)? Second, is my own suggestion right or wrong? Third, if his approach is so wrong we should change it, what arguments can I use to convince him? (He is absolutely no convinced by my "circular reasoning" argument). \nUpdate User246 answered \n\nOf course if you don\'t implicitly trust your Linq classes, you should test them.\n\nUnder which circumstances would I trust my Linq classes? Do I need to test them, or not? \nHe/she also said: \n\nOne way to test the Linq classes would be to write the data using Linq and then read the data using some other means\n\nThis is exactly what I was planning to do. My question was: Why? Why cannot I test the Linq classes with themselves? I thought that it is so obviously a bad idea that it doesn\'t need an explanation. But now that my co-worker does not believe that it is a bad idea, I realised that I have no arguments against it. So, what are the arguments for this view?\nI am trying to export my project as a runnable jar and run it without driver.exe files being present.

I am looking for answers that are specific to the gambling industry.\nAlso I would like to know about the test designs techniques that suites for this kind of software,\nOften times we file a bug and later see that it\'s marked as "As Designed" by the developer. Sometimes it gets marked as "Will Not Fix". \nWhen a bug is marked "Will Not Fix" then it is supposed to give credit to the tester and an acknowledgement that the bug was valid but it was decided not to fix it.\nWhat is the thinking process that can be used to decide whether a bug should go to "Will Not Fix" vs "As Designed"?\nI am first time trying out automated web UI testing.\nI just tried writing selenium python code which logs in to the website, waits till it redirects to target page and then tries to fetch certain information from that target page. I am facing several issues. For example I am getting TimeoutException when using headless chrome and I am not able to access properties of selected element on the target page. Also, I believe I might have to revise this function some times in future as the target website might change the UI/UX. So, I was thinking if I should use some tool which will allow me to use browser and capture my action as I do it and generate the script for my action, so that whenever the UI/UX of the target site changes, I will just have to redo action, recapture it in that tool and use the script generated. I just want to avoid time I am wasting in thinking and coding how I can imitate the actions myself. I have several such actions targetting different sites. So to reduce overall developement time I want to know if any such tool is there.\nMy test steps are-\n\na) go to google.com\nb) in the search box start typing a keyword example "IBM"\nc) google displays all the matching results\nd) Get the count of  matching results in a List of strings.\n\nfor (a), (b) I have:-\nSystem.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\\\Work\\\\chromedriver.exe");\n        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\n        driver.get("http://www.google.com");\n        WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.name("q"));\n        element.sendKeys("IBM");\n\nThe Question is how I do (d)?\n\nEnvironment : IE11\nWebdriver/Selenium version : 3.141.59\nLanguage : java\n\nSelenium code:\ndriver.findElementByXPath("//span[contains(text(),\'Logout\')]").click();**\n\nHTML code :\n<span class="v-menubar-menuitem-caption">Logout </span>\n\nChrome version : 75.0.3770.100 \n\nC:\\Users\\ramkrishna.bhandare\\Documents\\StressTestExamination\\OES\n  Project>Title SeleniumExam.\n\nC:\\Users\\ramkrishna.bhandare\\Documents\\StressTestExamination\\OES Project>java -j\nar ".\\Ramkrishna-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"\nStarting ChromeDriver 75.0.3770.8 (681f24ea911fe754973dda2fdc6d2a2e159dd300-refs\n/branch-heads/3770@{#40}) on port 22106\nOnly local connections are allowed.\nPlease protect ports used by ChromeDriver and related test frameworks to prevent\n access by malicious code.\nException is caught\norg.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: unknown error: failed to write automatio\nn extension zip\nBuild info: version: \'3.141.59\', revision: \'e82be7d358\', time: \'2018-11-14T08:17\n:03\'\nSystem info: host: \'CSS-D-060\', ip: \'10.10.10.218\', os.name: \'Windows 8.1\', os.a\nrch: \'amd64\', os.version: \'6.3\', java.version: \'1.8.0_144\'\nDriver info: driver.version: ChromeDriver\nremote stacktrace: Backtrace:\n        Ordinal0 [0x00C47DF3+1474035]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BC07D1+919505]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00B5CB43+510787]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00AF089E+67742]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00AEDF37+57143]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00B10CE4+199908]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00B1069D+198301]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00B0EECB+192203]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00AF5FF6+90102]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00AF765A+95834]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00AF7554+95572]\n        GetHandleVerifier [0x00DA231C+1249612]\n        GetHandleVerifier [0x00CF1575+525221]\n        GetHandleVerifier [0x00CF1310+524608]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00C55D28+1531176]\n        GetHandleVerifier [0x00CF1D4A+527226]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BD75F6+1013238]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BD746F+1012847]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BE365B+1062491]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BE379F+1062815]\n        Ordinal0 [0x00BE2745+1058629]\n        BaseThreadInitThunk [0x74F97C04+36]\n        RtlInitializeExceptionChain [0x774BAD8F+143]\n        RtlInitializeExceptionChain [0x774BAD5A+90]\n\n\nC:\\Users\\ramkrishna.bhandare\\Documents\\StressTestExamination\\OES Project>pause\nPress any key to continue . . .\n\nBelow is my HTML code.

The tests should automate UI actions like the regular browser tests, but without mocking the API. \nWhere would those tests belong to? FE or BE repository?\n\nPro FE: The tests interact with the browser/UI \nPro BE: I need to setup and interact with the DB. I.e. I need to have access to the models which are only available in the BE. Otherwise I would need to create them in the FE as well, just for the tests.\nThird option: only test FE & BE separately and mock API calls in FE tests?\n\nI have run into problems keeping my tests as object-oriented as possible. I have had to rewrite large portions of my code multiple times now, and I feel that there is a better approach to what I\'m doing. I explain my design below.\nDescription:\nI am using Selenium/Java to do some data integrity testing. The website being tested is used to create and manipulate batches. These batches have various properties such as name, ID number, different quantities, and ingredients. This data for each batch is supposed to change and be updated as you progress through the workflow of the website. The Selenium tests are supposed to simulate the workflow and track the batches to verify the data integrity of the website.\nCurrent design:\nI am using the Page Object Model to abstract the page classes from the test classes. In addition, I have a Batch class with all the properties and getters/setters for most properties. In all applicable page classes, I have a scrapeBatch() method which scrapes the batch information and returns a new Batch() object with those properties set. I then have an equals(Batch) method defined for the Batch object to verify that there are no discrepancies between two batches. The scrapeBatch() methods for the page classes right now use setters to assign the properties to a new Batch() object. In addition, different pages on the website display different properties.\nGoal:\nI would like to not have to use all the getters and setters to make the code more concise and to reuse more code wherever possible. I have read that using interfaces is the way to go, but I am having difficulty understanding how to define those interfaces in the most logical way. Any suggestions for ways to refactor my code would be greatly appreciated. I would be able to expand more on this too, if that is needed.\nI am required to build automated functional tests for an older web application which does not have much in the way of services or API. Normally that would mean using something like Selenium and interacting through a browser, but the automation has to go through our continuous integration, so it can\'t run through the browser UI. \nWe are using Jules for CI and build, and the automation has to succeed for the build to pass. Our team is trained in Selenium automation.\nI don\'t know where to start. What tools are there to perform functional testing against an application that doesn\'t have an API when there is no way to open a browser and test with it?\nI am building an android app to be used in rural areas (Saharan Africa, waaaay off the grid). The mobile app pulls down maps and map info from a server, uses the data, creates some new data (takes pictures, records GPS coordinates, etc), and then sends the data back to the server. We\'ve done our best to allow full function offline and to coordinate upload attempts with a network listener.\nIn August, we have a client who wants to roll this out to 1000 field workers in one shot, in rural Ghana. I\'d like to hear thoughts about best practices for testing online-offline-poor connection systems as well as other thoughts regarding systems built to function in rural areas.\nAlso, I\'m worried about rolling a system out to 1000 users at once.

As a tester, if I\'m testing a website and there are visual defects, however the test case I am testing against does not quantify the user-interface as part of the test.\nOne option is that:\n\nAs a quality assurance tester we would lose integrity by ignoring defects we know won\'t be raised by our test cases, simply because they aren\'t specified to be tested or part of the requirements.\n\nAnother option is:\n\nSaid element/defect is not within the scope, therefore irrelevant to our testing, henceforth the ticket should be passed rather than fail as it wasn\'t specified.\n\nMy team and I are currently discussing this right now with a real world issue, I\'d really love to hear feedback of other cases and best practices.\nI\'m new to chrome headless and I have a problem. \nI want to randomly select two links from a web page on the page being viewed and open them at the same time.\nIndeed my goal is to be able to have the screenshots of the three pages using Selenium with chrome headless the one currently being viewed and the other two open.\nThe following code already gives me the screenshots script of the current page.\n from selenium import webdriver\n\nchrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\nchrome_options.add_argument(\'--headless\')\n\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(\'/home/leonel/projet_/chromedriver\')\ndriver.get(\'https://openclassrooms.com/forum/sujet/ouvrir-un-lien-cliquable-present-sur-une-page-web#93235610\')\n\ndriver.get_screenshot_as_file(\'/home/leonel/projet_/screenshot.png\')\n\nprint(driver.title)\n\nThank you in advance.\nUse case :\nI need to import orders from Excel file. I need to browse a Excel file.\n\nHeavily simplified example that I\'m trying to make language agnostic: I have an XmlView Object that has a constant property FACTORY_NAME labeled "factory" and a constant property VIEW_NAME labeled "view". There is also a twodimensional string array somewhere that contains the links between the numbers 1, 3, 4 5 and a localization variable for their string representation in English, German and French, which are in resource files somewhere.\nI then have a REST API call on /factory/{id:\\\\d+} that returns <factory><view>%did:%sid</view></factory>, where factory is whatever FACTORY_NAME is, view is whatever VIEW_NAME is, %did is whatever number you entered as a path parameter and can be either, 1, 3, 4 or 5 as a number, and %sid is a localized representation of that number (so one, ein, un; three, drei, trois; four, vier, quatre; five, f\xc3\xbcnf, cinq). Note that the actual code is many times more complicated with hundreds of API endpoints that do far more complicated things, this is just an example.\nIn the above contrived example, there are essentially 3 things I want to test: \n\nThat the /factory/{id:\\\\d+} endpoint exists;\nThat any id number I enter in the above endpoint is in the expected response value, and that it\'s in the allowed values for the id property;\nThat the response XML is what I expect it to be.\n\nThere are other things to test, but these will do for this example.\nBased on the above example, to what extent should this test use hardcoded values and/or iteration to test that this code returns the expected values?\n\nShould I write 4 separate assertions that a GET to the factory endpoint gives an expected value, with the contacted endpoint hardcoded and comparing the XML response to the string above, hardcoded in the test? This seems kinda brittle since any change will break my test and I\'ll have a lot of repeated code.\nShould I write 4 separate assertions as above, again with the factory endpoint hardcoded, but then using Xpath to retrieve the variable part and then comparing this to a hardcoded value?\nShould I write 4 separate assertions, but with everything that\'s possibly variable being retrieved from the rest of my codebase?\nShould I iterate over my localized string array and do an assert for each item in the array?\nShould I do something else?\n\nI\'m not sure what to do. Using the existing variables removes a lot of manually changing my tests when I change something, but it also means that I\'m just checking if my values are processed correctly by my code and not if the values themselves are correct. Are there any generally accepted best practices for this scenario?\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\n\n# create a new Firefox session\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox()\ndriver.implicitly_wait(30)\ndriver.maximize_window()\n\n# Navigate to the application home page\ndriver.get("http://www.google.com")\n\n# get the search textbox\nsearch_field = driver.find_element_by_id("lst-ib")\nsearch_field.clear()\n\n# enter search keyword and submit\nsearch_field.send_keys("Selenium WebDriver Interview questions")\nsearch_field.submit()\n\n# get the list of elements which are displayed after the search\n# currently on result page using find_elements_by_class_name method\nlists= driver.find_elements_by_class_name("_Rm")\n\n# get the number of elements found\nprint ("Found " + str(len(lists)) + " searches:")\n\n# iterate through each element and print the text that is\n# name of the search\n\ni=0\nfor listitem in lists:\n   print (listitem.get_attribute("innerHTML"))\n   i=i+1\n   if(i>10):\n      break\n\n# close the browser window\ndriver.quit()\n\nError message:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File "C:/Users/HP/Documents/selenium1.py", line 13, in <module>\n    search_field = driver.find_element_by_id("lst-ib")\n  File "C:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37\\lib\\site-packages\\selenium\\webdriver\\remote\\webdriver.py", line 360, in find_element_by_id\n    return self.find_element(by=By.ID, value=id_)\n  File "C:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37\\lib\\site-packages\\selenium\\webdriver\\remote\\webdriver.py", line 978, in find_element\n    \'value\': value})[\'value\']\n  File "C:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37\\lib\\site-packages\\selenium\\webdriver\\remote\\webdriver.py", line 321, in execute\n    self.error_handler.check_response(response)\n  File "C:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37\\lib\\site-packages\\selenium\\webdriver\\remote\\errorhandler.py", line 242, in check_response\n    raise exception_class(message, screen, stacktrace)\nselenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate element: [id="lst-ib"]\n\nMy code:\npublic class Test {\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n\n    System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "****************");\n\n    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\n\n    driver.manage().window().maximize();\n\n    driver.get("**************");\n\n    driver.manage().window().maximize();\n\n    driver.findElement(By.xpath(".//label[text()=\'Create A Profile\']")).click();\n\n    driver.findElement(By.xpath("..//div[@class=\'captcha-input\']/input[@id=\'Module-Captcha-Captcha-input-78189cbe4512de369a72d22c7050fbec0ea3f5cb86f351bafbb344df0f04508deebb23aa6f910098a68acaace3eb00ab\' ]")).sendKeys("000");\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nThe html\n<div class="captcha-input"> \n    <label class="form-label block required" for="Module-Captcha-Captcha-input-78189cbe4512de369a72d22c7050fbec0ea3f5cb86f351bafbb344df0f04508deebb23aa6f910098a68acaace3eb00ab"> \n    <input id="Module-Captcha-Captcha-input-78189cbe4512de369a72d22c7050fbec0ea3f5cb86f351bafbb344df0f04508deebb23aa6f910098a68acaace3eb00ab" class="full-width narrow Component-Form-Validation-Validation field" name="captcha.captchaSolution" data-validation-error="" data-validation-message="Please enter the correct captcha " aria-required="true" required="required" type="text"/> \n</div>\n\nI get the error no such element: Unable to locate element on the last code statement.\nelement = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, \'//*[@id="liveAgentChatLogText"]//*[contains(string(.), "THE_TEXT_STRING_I_AM_LOOKING_FOR")]\')\n\ndriver.find_element_by_xpath(\'//*[@id="contactFirstName"]\').send_keys(firstName)\ndriver.find_element_by_xpath(\'//*[@id="contactLastName"]\').send_keys(lastName)\n\nThis one would say for an example, it\'d say "SyntaxError: invalid syntax",\nthe second one.\nelement = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, \'//*[@id="liveAgentChatLogText"]//*[contains(string(.), "THE_TEXT_STRING_I_AM_LOOKING_FOR")]\')\n\nSyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing\nSo, I really have no clue what to do, everything that\'s underneath the code, says invalid syntax, and if it\'s above it says unexpected EOF...\nHow do I detect text inside of this, this is HTML & this is XPath.

(Source https://docs.pact.io/getting_started/what_is_pact_good_for#what-is-it-not-good-for )\n\nI\'ve had a look at question "Testing interactions with external systems" but it\'s not exactly what I\'m looking for.\nAny ideas are welcome.\nEDIT: I\'ll give some more example details to help frame a possible problem scenario:\n\nI have full access to the code that implements this consumer for all\nthe external APIs;\nI have access to test environments of both my service and the external provider services;\nI have the ability to raise my service on a local level, but not the external services themselves;\nI have access to some documentation and postman collections of some of the external apis;\nImplementation of the feature "consuming external service A", sometimes jams/breaks "consumption of another service B", or even\ndisrupts other unrelated parts of "my gateway service";\nImplementation of "my gateway service" is bound to an edge case scenario: weak development process, tightly coupled and extensive\ncode, inexistent unit checks, low code quality checks, and overall\nhandicapped/rushed development and requirements gathering process.\n\nI\'m looking for some general advice with an API framework I am setting up using C# and RestSharp as the client library. I\'ve successfully set up an initial test, but I\'m now looking at creating a series of assertions to ensure that certain values are returned in the response\nMy test looks as below:\n        [Test]\n    public void ShouldHaveDataAttributes()\n    {\n        var restClient = new RestClient("http://ergast.com/api/f1");\n\n        var restRequest = new RestRequest("2016/circuits.json", Method.GET);\n\n        var restResponse = restClient.Execute(restRequest);\n\n        dynamic jsonResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(restResponse.Content);\n\n        dynamic jsonObject = jsonResponse.MRData.CircuitTable;\n        int circuitId = (int)jsonObject.season;\n        System.Console.WriteLine(jsonObject);\n    }\n\nThe jsonObject returns the below data:\n{\n  "season": "2016",\n  "Circuits": [\n    {\n      "circuitId": "albert_park",\n      "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Grand_Prix_Circuit",\n      "circuitName": "Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit",\n      "Location": {\n        "lat": "-37.8497",\n        "long": "144.968",\n        "locality": "Melbourne",\n        "country": "Australia"\n      }\n    }]\n}\n\nMy question is how would I specifically check that, for example the correct "circuitId" is returned or that the "circuitName" value is "Albert Park"? I\'m keen to carry on utilising RestSharp for my framework so was hoping there was an extension to allow me to do that\nAs I look into writing automation frameworks at the API layer(relatively new to this area), a question that keeps cropping up in my mind is.....why should I write an automation framework at code level in C#(with RestSharp) or Java(RestAssured), as opposed to using a tool like Postman or SoapUI and utilising what they have to create a framework?\nWhat would be the pro\'s and con\'s of each?\nI\'m currently looking at building an API test automation framework for a series of Rest Services, utilising c#. Coming from a UI-automation background I was after some advise on assertions when testing against an API. \nObviously there are a whole array of different assertions that can be carried out but based on peoples experiences are there certain assertions that must be done? e.g. that the Expected Status Code is returned?

My literal job on this is solely unit-testing, documenting the code under test, and of course reporting any fails with the rest of the dev team. \nThere\'s a few methods under test that hit other methods under test, that may hit others, that I\'m responsible for testing. For example, at the time of me writing this, I\'m trying to test this method:\n//SendRequest This is used to contact the apiserver synchronously.\nfunc (apiPath *APIPath) SendRequest(context interface{}, tokenHandler *apiToken.APITokenHandlerSt,\n    header map[string]string,\n    urlParams []string, urlQueries url.Values,\n    jsonBody []byte) apiCore.CallResultSt {\n    if apiToken := tokenHandler.GetToken(apiPath.AuthType, apiPath.Scope); apiToken != nil {\n        return apiPath.APICoreHandler.SendRequest(\n            context,\n            apiToken.Token,\n            apiPath.GetPath(urlParams, urlQueries), apiPath.Type,\n            header, jsonBody)\n    } else {\n        errMsg, _ := json.Marshal(errors.InvalidAuthentication())\n        return apiCore.CallResultSt{DetailObject: errMsg, IsSucceeded: false}\n    }\n}\n\nwhere the receiver struct is defined to be \n//APIPath=======================\n//Used for url construction\ntype APIPath struct {\n    APICoreHandler *apiCore.APICoreSt\n    // domain name of API\n    DomainPath string\n    ParentAPI  *APIPath\n    Type       apiCore.APIType\n    // subfunction name\n    SubFunc          string\n    KeyName          string\n    AutoAddKeyToPath bool\n    AuthType         oAuth2.OAuth2Type\n    Scope            string\n}\n\nNote that method has an external dependency. It is defined thus: \n//Establish the request to send to the server\nfunc (a *APICoreSt) SendRequest(context interface{}, token string, apiURL string, callType APIType, header map[string]string, jsonBody []byte) CallResultSt {\n    if header == nil {\n        header = make(map[string]string)\n    }\n    if header["Authorization"] == "" {\n        header["Authorization"] = "Bearer " + token\n    }\n    header["Scope"] = GeneralScope\n    header["Content-Type"] = "application/json; charset=UTF-8"\n    return a.CallServer(context, callType, apiURL, header, jsonBody)\n}\n\nand that method ends up hitting this one: \n//CallServer Calls the server\n//\n// Parameters:\n// - `context` : a context to pass to the server\n// - `apiType` : the HTTP method (`GET`,`POST`,`PUT`,`DELETE`,...)\n// - `apiURL` : the URL to hit\n// - `header` : request header\n// - `jsonBody`: the JSON body to send\n//\n// Returns:\n// - a CallResultSt. This CallResultSt might have an error for its `DetailObject`\nfunc (a *APICoreSt) CallServer(context interface{}, apiType APIType, apiURL string, header map[string]string, jsonBody []byte) CallResultSt {\n\n    var (\n        Url     = a.BaseURL + apiURL\n        err     error\n        res     *http.Response\n        resBody json.RawMessage\n        hc      = &http.Client{}\n        req     = new(http.Request)\n    )\n\n    req, err = http.NewRequest(string(apiType), Url, bytes.NewBuffer(jsonBody))\n    if err != nil {\n        //Use a map instead of errorSt so that it doesn\'t create a heavy dependency.\n        errorSt := map[string]string{\n            "Code":    "ez020300007",\n            "Message": "The request failed to be created.",\n        }\n        logger.Instance.LogError(err.Error())\n        err, _ := json.Marshal(errorSt)\n        return CallResultSt{DetailObject: err, IsSucceeded: false}\n    }\n\n    for k, v := range header {\n        req.Header.Set(k, v)\n    }\n\n    res, err = hc.Do(req)\n    if res != nil {\n        resBody, err = ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)\n        res.Body = ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewBuffer(resBody))\n    }\n    return CallResultSt{resBody, logger.Instance.CheckAndHandleErr(context, res)}\n\n}\n\n(The struct these two methods are on is omitted for brevity: there\'s only one field of that struct that it relies on.)\nThese type of situations keep popping up in the code under test, and yesterday, I confronted the boss about this, citing these dependencies, and the fact that there\'s no struct makes them literally impossible to test-double (fake,stub,mock). I was merely asking to refactor it so that it hits an interface method, declared in the same file as the dependency, which those struct methods would implement (implementing interfaces is implicit in Golang).  It turned into a bit of an argument, and he brought the talking point "What do you do about third-party dependencies and built-in dependencies?" I told him that there\'s usually a way to test-double those concerns out (fakes, mocks, stubs), but he wouldn\'t budge.\nWhat to do about this situation to convince him that this refactoring is indeed necessary, and failing that, what should I do about this situation?\nUPDATE: The method under test has other business dependencies, defined thus: \n// GetToken returns the token having the specified `tokenType` and `scope`\n//\n// Parameters:\n// - `tokenType`\n// - `scope`\n//\n// Returns:\n// - pointer to Token having `tokenType`,`scope` or nil\nfunc (ath *APITokenHandlerSt) GetToken(tokenType oAuth2.OAuth2Type, scope string) *APITokenSt {\n    if ath == nil {\n        return nil\n    }\n    if i := ath.FindToken(tokenType, scope); i == -1 {\n        return nil\n    } else {\n        return &ath.Tokens[i]\n    }\n}\n\n// FindToken finds token with specified `scope` and `tokenType`\n//\n// Parameters:\n// - `tokenType` :  the `OAuth2Type` of the token we want\n// - `scope`: the scope of the token we want\n//\n// Returns:\n// - the index of the token in ath.Tokens, or -1 if it cannot be found\nfunc (ath *APITokenHandlerSt) FindToken(tokenType oAuth2.OAuth2Type, scope string) int {\n    for i, t := range ath.Tokens {\n        if t.TokenType == tokenType &&\n            t.Scope == scope {\n            return i\n        }\n    }\n    return -1\n}\n\nI am unable to identify element. please find my below code.\nWebElement editorFrame = dr.findElement(By.id("1536219451331-0-uiGrid-000L-cell"));\n\nWhich one is the better option for web application testing - JBehave or Robot Framework?\nComparison between JBehave and Robot Framewrok.\nWhile clicking on UI-automatorviewer I\'m getting below error:\n/Users/XXXX/Library/Android/sdk/tools/bin/uiautomatorviewer ; exit;\n-Djava.ext.dirs=/Users/bigdaddy/Library/Android/sdk/tools/lib/x86_64:/Users/XXXX/Library/Android/sdk/tools/lib is not supported.

Once my current spec is done running I\'m calling a page object function to delete all the components to clean up the workspace before moving on to the next spec. I\'d say about 50% of the time I\'m noticing a stale element reference error on the line with my .filter() function. I added some log statements to see if I could figure out what\'s happening and noticed some behavior I didn\'t understand. It seems like for every component in my list, the filter function is running four times. Anyone know if this is expected behavior? \nThis is my delete function:\npublic async deleteAllComponents(): Promise<void> {\n    await this.componentsTab.click();\n\n    // get list of all current components\n    const components = element.all(this.projectComponentsLocator);\n    const componentNames = await components.getText();\n\n    // delete each component\n    for (const name of componentNames) {\n        await this.deleteComponentFromProjTree(name);\n    }\n}\n\nThis is the function that is throwing the stale element reference error:\npublic async deleteComponentFromProjTree(componentName: string): Promise<void> {\n    await this.componentsTab.click();\n    // get new list each time because list goes stale after a component is deleted\n    const components = element.all(this.projectComponentsLocator);        \n\n    log(\'components found:\', await components.count());\n    log(\'deleting component:\', componentName);\n\n    const relevantComponent = await components.filter((component: ElementFinder) => {\n        return component.getText().then((text: string) => {\n            log(\'current component:\', text);\n            log(\'relevant component found:\', text.includes(componentName));\n            return text.includes(componentName);\n        });\n    })\n    .first();\n\n    await relevantComponent.click();\n\n    const componentMenu = relevantComponent.$(this.componentMenuLocator);\n    await componentMenu.click();\n\n    if (await this.deleteOption.isPresent()) {\n        await this.deleteOption.click();\n        await this.confirmDeleteBtn.click();\n    } else {\n        // component cannot be deleted so just exit menu\n        browser.actions().sendKeys(protractor.Key.ESCAPE).perform();\n    }\n};\n\nWhen I turn on the debug logging here is what I see in the console. Why does it seem like each component is running through the filter function 4 times? When there were 2 components found the function ran 8 times, when there was only 1 it still ran 4 times. What\'s this all about?\n\nWithin a test suite, each test case generates a large amount of test data, which is used as input to the next test case in the sequence. Frequently we want to manipulate the test data to cause failures in or otherwise test the downstream tools. These manipulations are significant test activities whose outputs can be reused in other test suites, so I\'d like to track them separately from the test cases.\nSince the test activities themselves have similar fields to the test cases (precondition, postcondition, etc.) my naive inclination is to capture them alongside test cases (TC), with a different identifier (TA), in the same spreadsheet:\n\n(Additional fields, not shown, are Traceability, Input, Steps, Actual Output, Test Result, and Status.)\nFurther extending my naive inclinations, I could add preparation/automation activities and track these separately. For all intents and purposes, we can assume this is captured in an Excel spreadsheet or similar and that we can add any fields we need.\n\nThis seems fairly nonstandard, so I appreciate any thoughts/alternatives. \nI\'m automating an app and using winappdriver tool with java language for the same.

Our CTO thinks "Role Play Test" kind of sounds childish and the board of directors might think we are playing an online game like World of Warcraft instead of doing serious work.\nI know, it\'s some kind of Exploratory Testing or Bug Bush, but the important aspect, in my opinion, is the interactivity and the role play which is not really covered by "Exploratory Testing".\n(Note: This question is quite similar to Is there a name for these kinds of tests? - however, it\'s not quite the same, since the interactivity aspect is not really stressed there.)\nI want convert the milliseconds to seconds in TestNg emailable report.\nPlease help?\n\nI\'ve come across an interesting problem while automating our web application using selenium webdriver.

Is there any way we can wait for the scroll event to finish before executing click?\nIt\'s just a little issue, but one that pops up in my mind regularly when writing test scripts.\nImagine you have an application which does some car tax calculation, having a REST service which has a method for calculating the tax and an HTML interface with a screen to enter the required input and display the tax to pay. The HTML interface makes uses of the REST service and does nothing more than some input validation, passing the values to the REST interface and then display the tax to pay.\nLet\'s assume you developed several service tests for the REST service, e.g. using SoapUI, some with invalid input (weight=0kg or price=\xe2\x82\xac0) and one with valid input (weight=900kg, price=\xe2\x82\xac25000).\nThe HTML interface is tested for usability, browser compatibility and other relevant quality attributes, which do not apply for the service test. The system test, e.g. using Protractor, contains some test cases concerning input validation, like an empty field for the weight of the car. You also want to verify if the tax calculation displays the correct amount to pay for valid input. Would you use the same test data as used in the service test, because you have the expected results already available, or would you deliberately choose different test data in order to implicitly test the business logic more thoroughly?\nLet\'s assume two situations:\n\nYou know the unit tests concerning the tax calculation have a\ncoverage of about 80% and you know the developers are aware of techniques like equivalence partitioning. A decent base for the \ntest pyramid.\nThe unit tests concerning the tax calculation have a\ncoverage of just 40% and there is no time and budget to write more unit\ntests and raise the coverage, unfortunately, a common situation.\n\nIn the latter situation, you could, of course, extend the service tests to increase coverage on a higher level, but even then you have to decide if you want to deliberately use different input values for the system test. \nI am trying to print product details from searched results from this page.\nThis is the function I used for that.\n@Test(priority = 1)\npublic void printSearchItem() {\n\n    // print the product details\n    java.util.List<WebElement> products = driver.findElements(By.className("sresult lvresult clearfix li"));\n\n    for(WebElement product:products) {\n\n        System.out.println(product.getText());      \n    }   \n}\n\nBut I am getting below error:\n\norg.openqa.selenium.InvalidSelectorException: invalid selector: Compound \n      class names not permitted\n\nThis is the html code for one product.\n<li id="item3f91166db6" _sp="p2045573.m1686.l0" listingid="273017105846" class="sresult lvresult clearfix li" r="1">\n\n    <div class="lvpic pic img left" iid="273017105846">\n        <div class="lvpicinner full-width picW">\n\n            <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Apple-Watch-series-3-38mm-Sp-Gray-dark-Olive-Sp-loop-GPS-Cellular-Brand-New/273017105846?epid=15012720917&amp;hash=item3f91166db6:g:SsMAAOSwEUdaVBxw" class="img imgWr2">\n                <img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/thumbs/images/g/SsMAAOSwEUdaVBxw/s-l225.jpg" class="img" alt="Apple Watch series 3 38mm Sp Gray, dark Olive Sp loop (GPS+Cellular) Brand New!!">\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <h3 class="lvtitle"><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Apple-Watch-series-3-38mm-Sp-Gray-dark-Olive-Sp-loop-GPS-Cellular-Brand-New/273017105846?epid=15012720917&amp;hash=item3f91166db6:g:SsMAAOSwEUdaVBxw" class="vip" title="Click this link to access Apple Watch series 3 38mm Sp Gray, dark Olive Sp loop (GPS+Cellular) Brand New!!">Apple Watch series 3 38mm Sp Gray, dark Olive Sp loop (GPS+Cellular) Brand New!!</a>\n            </h3>\n    <div class="lvsubtitle">\n        Brand New</div>\n    <div class="star-ratings ">\n        <a href="https://www.ebay.com/p/Apple%2DWatch%2DSeries%2D3%2D38mm%2DCellular%2DGPS/15012720917?iid=273017105846#UserReviews" _sp="p2045573.m1686.l8597" aria-label="Rating: 5.0 out of 5, Click to read reviews">\n            <i class="star-ratings__star star-ratings__star--full"></i>\n            <i class="star-ratings__star star-ratings__star--full"></i>\n            <i class="star-ratings__star star-ratings__star--full"></i>\n            <i class="star-ratings__star star-ratings__star--full"></i>\n            <i class="star-ratings__star star-ratings__star--full"></i>\n        </a>\n        <a href="https://www.ebay.com/p/Apple%2DWatch%2DSeries%2D3%2D38mm%2DCellular%2DGPS/15012720917?iid=273017105846#UserReviews" class="star-ratings__review-num" _sp="p2045573.m1686.l8597" aria-label="4 product ratings, Click to read reviews">4 product ratings</a>\n    </div>\n    <ul class="lvprices left space-zero" _sp="p2045573.m1686.l0">\n\n        <li class="lvprice prc">\n            <span class="bold">\n                        $480.00</span>\n        </li>\n        <li class="lvformat">\n            <span>\n                    Buy It Now</span>\n        </li>\n        <li class="lvshipping">\n            <span class="ship">\n        <span class="fee">\n                                    +$45.97 shipping</span>\n            </span>\n        </li>\n        <li class="lvextras" _sp="p2045573.m1686.l0">\n            <div class="hotness bold">\n\n            </div>\n\n        </li>\n\n    </ul>\n    <ul class="lvdetails left space-zero full-width">\n        <li>\n            From United States</li>\n        <li>\n            <div class="epli">Customs services and international tracking provided</div>\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n\nHow to fix this and print the product values?\nAs a part of the Automation Test, I have to set up my test framework to run tests on Microsoft Tablet(real device), I am not sure how to connect my framework with the tablet device. please suggest some reliable approaches.\nSelenium framework is written using C# and NUnit.\n\nTarget browser is Microsoft Tablet\'s chrome browser\nBoth are in the same wifi\nContinuous test is not considered for now\nReal device is preferred over the online emulators\nWindows 8.1 is the tablet OS version\n\nI want to test the image upload functionality using Protractor but my written script didn\'t work.\n\nWhen we click on the dialogue box image it opens the window to select the desired image.

However, since these test were written Vimeo now requirs OAuth2 rather than OAuth1.\nI\'m having difficulty trying to find resources online advising how I might be able to set up OAuth2 for my test.

I know that browsers such as Safari and Firefox can simulate it via changing User-Agents but that\'s not a true simulation of the actual mobile browser.\n\nWhat are some tools for testing Mobile web apps?\n\nWe use SilkTest 2010 Open Agent to perform Automated Web Testing.  Our scripts currently work on IE6 - IE8 and on Firefox 3.X.  \nIE9 has changed modal boxes to unintrusive pop-ups at the bottom of the screen which breaks our scripts.  Also, SilkTest does not recognize these pop-ups. \nRecording a script without the modal boxes work fine, but when we record something that involves modal boxes, the SilkTest recorder does not retain any recorded steps (including the ones recorded before the modal box was encountered).\nDoes anyone know how to overcome this problem?\nProvided you are ready to hire your first (or next) QA team member, what are the key properties of a person you will pay attention to?\nI need to build a lot of regression tests for our product at work and I plan on using Selenium. I am concerned about building tests that will become quickly outdated and broken based on the fast pace of our product development.\n\nWhat is the best way to build / structure the tests in a way that will minimize the work needed to keep the tests up to date as the product changes and improves?\n\nIn our Project we have a test case based on Rational Test Manager (RUP Process).\nThis test case includes: \n\ndescription, \npreconditions, \nsteps \nexpected results for each step and finally a notes section.  \n\nI feel that having expected results for each step is an over kill in writing a test case and includes lot of redundant steps.  \nWhat are the test case templates that everyone else uses?\nWould this differ for Web, Desktop and Mobile?\nI am currently using Moq to write automated tests for System.Web.HttpApplication in C#: \npublic FakeHttpApplication CreateBaseMocks()\n{\n    MockContext = new Mock<HttpContextBase>();\n    MockRequest = new Mock<HttpRequestBase>();\n    MockResponse = new Mock<HttpResponseBase>();\n    MockSession = new Mock<HttpSessionStateBase>();\n    MockServer = new Mock<HttpServerUtilityBase>();\n\n    MockContext.Setup(ctx => ctx.Request).Returns(MockRequest.Object);\n    MockContext.Setup(ctx => ctx.Response).Returns(MockResponse.Object);\n    MockContext.Setup(ctx => ctx.Session).Returns(MockSession.Object);\n    MockContext.Setup(ctx => ctx.Server).Returns(MockServer.Object);\n\n    HttpContextBase = MockContext.Object;\n    HttpRequestBase = MockRequest.Object;\n    HttpResponseBase = MockResponse.Object;\n\n    MockRequest.Setup(r => r.Headers).Returns(new NameValueCollection());\n    return this;\n}\n\npublic FakeHttpApplication SetupNormalRequestValues()\n{\n    //Context.User\n    MockUser = new Mock<IPrincipal>();\n    MockIdentity = new Mock<IIdentity>();\n    MockContext.Setup(context => context.User).Returns(MockUser.Object);\n    MockUser.Setup(context => context.Identity).Returns(MockIdentity.Object);\n\n    //Request\n    MockRequest.Setup(request => request.InputStream).Returns(new MemoryStream());\n\n    //Response\n    MockResponse.Setup(response => response.OutputStream).Returns(new MemoryStream());\n    return this;\n}\n\nHowever, setting up the objects this way leaves a lot to be desired considering that most of the internal objects and properties remain null. Does anyone know of a better way to do this?  I am looking for a way to instantiate a more lifelike HttpApplication object and don\'t mind a little complexity.\nJavaScript is everywhere right now. With the advent of jQuery and other associated JavaScript frameworks it\'s amazingly simple to add very powerful user interactions to web sites and web applications. However, with the addition of JavaScript and AJAX the movement away from HTTP and into a more asynchronous pattern has created new challenges. \nCertainly you could use, Selenium. But what other frameworks have people used? I\'m currently interested in things like:\n\nPhantomJS\nEnvJS\nPyQT\n\n\n"Is this going to be a stand-up fight sir, or a bug hunt?"\n  - Hudson\n\nI\'ve always wondered what the secrets were to writing a great bug report. Over time I\'ve narrowed down the activity to three basic elements. \n\nReplicate: Once you\'ve found the bug, replicate it.\nDocument: Write it down, pack in detail where necessary.\nCommunicate: Input it into the bug tracker and tell someone.\n\nReplicate - Clearly this is the most hated step because you just made something break, why should we break it again? Unfortunately, it\'s part of the process. Bugs that are repeatable often give the development/implementation team a very clear view into what might be going wrong. A bug that happens one time can be very hard to track down. So, your first step if you find something wrong is to try and make it happen again. This is why it\'s critical that you mentally keep track of what you\'re doing and what you\'ve clicked. Certain combinations can yield bugs, while others won\'t.\nDocument - The only thing worse than a bug is a bug without any details. For example, what\'s wrong with the following bug report?\n\nMy order failed. I think it is broken.\n\nAside from the fact that your order failed, there\'s no detail! Examples of very excellent detail:\n\nSteps to repeat the bug (see Step 1)\nWhat you were expecting vs. what you got\nError messages that appear on the page\nWhat browser/operating system were you using\n\nSo if you were to rewrite the bug like the following - this will make it easier for the implementation team to investigate and solve the issue:\n\nI\'m using the following:\n  OS: Mac OS X (10.4.9)\n  Browser: Firefox 2.0.0.3\nMy order for a snuggle puppies on yoursitehere.com wouldn\'t go\n  through and I\'m not sure why. When I try to place the order, I end up on\n  the order entry page with the following error message: "We\'re sorry, our\n  records indicate another order has already been placed...."\n  I was expecting to end up on the receipt page with a confirmation message\n  and with a confirmation email in my inbox and instead I\'m getting an error.\nTry the following steps:\nYour steps here\n\nCommunicate - In order for a bug to get corrected, the implementation team needs to know about it. This doesn\'t end up being as plodding as it sounds. But the sooner you let your primary developer/project manager/testing know the sooner it can be put into the queue to be fixed.\nThis is how I\'ve done it ... but what makes a great bug report in your mind? \n\nI\'m building a solo project myself. (Java backend, Java AWT frontend. No lectures about AWT vs swing vs *wt, please :-))\n\nIt\'s fairly straightforward\nPrimary server - keeps user information\nContent server - keeps content information\nClient - the user interface\nClient opens up and connects to the primary server. Depending on the content, the connection gets bounced to the proper content server (of course, the primary and content servers do some communication to prepare the authorization of the new client coming in.)\nAt what point should I be writing tests? I want to balance the testing aspect of it with making progress in development, and I\'m not sure what the proper balance of that is. I\'m much more concerned about the front end than I am about the back end. I pretty much see the GUI as a simple mechanism for calling back-end functionality with a lot of cool pictures. :-)\nObviously there are paradigms like TDD which would dictate no code is written without a test. But this is just my moonlighting project that I do in my spare time. It\'s mostly for fun (although I\'d love to see a profit off it.)\nThere\'s currently between 30-40 classes. There are currently no tests of any kind (unit, functional, integration are what I plan to do eventually.)\n\nHow do I know when the right time to stop development and put some tests together is?\n\nI have a project that has almost complete unit test coverage. There\'s only one statement that isn\'t covered and I can\'t work out a good way to do so. Say the project is called foo, I have foo/commands.py:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n[...]\ndef main(argv):\n    [...]\n\nif __name__ == \'__main__\':\n    return main(sys.argv) # This line allegedly not covered by tests\n\nI do have a test for it! foo/tests/test_commands.py:\nimport unittest\nclass CommandsTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_direct_call(self):\n        proc = subprocess.Popen([\'python\', \'foo/commands.py\', \'help\'], stdout=PIPE)\n        stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()\n        self.assertTrue(stdout.startswith(\'usage:\'))\n        self.assertEquals(0, proc.returncode)\n\n(That\'s not my actual test, but it\'s along those lines.)\nI use nose as my test runner:\nnosetests --cover-erase --cover-tests --with-coverage --cover-package=foo -vs foo\n\nThe problem is that this particular statement isn\'t considered "covered", because I use plain python instead of coverage.py (or python-coverage as its called on Ubuntu). I could change it to python-coverage, but I don\'t really want to do that:\n\nIt may not be available.\nIf it is available, it may be named differently.\nIt\'s ok if someone wants to run the test suite without the coverage stuff.\n\nRight now, I have a dreadful hack to do it:\ninterpreter = \'coverage\' in sys.modules [\'python-coverage\', \'run\'] or [\'python\']\n\nNot exactly the most readable code, but imagine the irony of using the more readable approach:\nif \'coverage\' in sys.modules:\n    interpreter = [\'python-coverage\', \'run\']\nelse:\n    interpreter = [\'python\']\n\n...only to realise that the "else:" branch ends up not getting called when coverage is enabled, so I just have another line of code that\'s not exercised by unit tests.\nMy goal is to fail the test suite if there isn\'t 100% coverage. I "need" the statement in foo/commands.py because it\'s a very convenient way to test things during development (in actual installs, it\'ll use distutils console_scripts magic to call into this file).\nIdeas? Prior art? Anything?\nNote: 100% coverage is by no means a guarantee that everything is great. Less than 100% is a guarantee, though, that there\'s something you\'re not testing. I can easily verify the 100% coverage, so I see no reason not to.\nI\'ve had a quick read around this subject and it looks like Action Recordings can be made in Internet Explorer 9 and then played back with fast forward. However my question is about recordings made in earlier versions of Internet Explorer.\nBefore I upgrade to IE9 can anyone confirm for me that my Action Recordings that I made in IE8 with Test Manager will indeed work in IE9 (without having to re-record and adjust anything significantly).\nI\'m trying to learn more about software testing, so I want to know which books you would recommend on this topic\nI\'m currently working (almost finishing) a Java project that consists on a server application and some client applications on the same network, that will communicate with the server only to request informations. So what tools are suggested to use for this kind of testing?\nI\'m interested in hearing suggestions for ways of recording exploratory test session notes.  We currently use a mixture of Session Tester and a wiki for recording test notes.\nI like many things about Session Tester: it\'s unobtrusive and lightweight so it doesn\'t get in the way and distract me from my testing, it\'s cross-platform, and I very much like being able to tag "issues" for later follow-up during testing, and having them conveniently gathered under one heading in the report afterwards. (Being able to search plaintext files for key words later is also very handy).\nDrawbacks? It\'s (as the name suggests) aimed at session based testing, and our exploratory sessions tend to be more threaded, and less about discrete sessions.  \nSuppose you\'re working with bright programmer, but every time you test the code you find a serious, obvious bugs. Things the programmer could have noticed if they did their own testing before checking in. \nGreat testers are meant to do great work, and finding obvious bugs is both a waste of QA expertise and a slow way for the team to get things done.\nHow do you tell a programmer to test their own code before checking in, instead of just "chucking it over the wall"? \nJoel has his "The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing (version 3.0)", but that\'s really for programmers. \nHow should you go about interviewing testers?\nWe ask programmers to program on a whiteboard; how you can you ask testers to test in an interview, in a way that tells you something useful about them?\nPerhaps programmers have their own unit tests, perhaps as the result of doing Test-Driven Development. They run these tests very often; perhaps every few minutes, but at least a few times each day.\nIn my experience, QA\'s automated tests tend to go after bigger chunks of functionality and are therefore slower and usually less reliable than programmer\'s unit tests. Still, there is a lot of value in getting the results of these tests in programmer\'s hands as soon as possible.\nShould QA push for programmers running QA\'s automated tests? Should QA insist that all of their automated tests pass before checking in? Should the nightly build process include a run of QA\'s automated tests?\n(I wrote nightly build but that only makes sense if you have a nightly build. I suspect that many shops don\'t have this. I suspect that how QA is done varies very widely, and that awareness of other ways of doing things is very limited.)\n\nThe "Joel Test" lists 12 items to look for in a software company:\n\n\nDo you use source control?\nCan you make a build in one step?\nDo you make daily builds?\nDo you have a bug database?\nDo you fix bugs before writing new code?\nDo you have an up-to-date schedule?\nDo you have a spec?\nDo programmers have quiet working conditions?\nDo you use the best tools money can buy?\nDo you have testers?\nDo new candidates write code during their interview?\nDo you do hallway usability testing?\n\n\nIf you\'re a tester looking for a testing job, is this the right set of things to look for?  \n\nI\'ve got a Perl-based Selenium instance running on my Win7 workstation.  When I fire up a test script, I get an error "Lock file still present!"\nCaused by org.openqa.selenium.server.browserlaunchers.FirefoxChromeLauncher$FileLockRemainedException: Lock file still present! C:\\Users\\ME\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\customProfileDir557f5502ab184789aed95c3c1031feff\\parent.lock\n\n\nSo far, I have:\n\nrebooted the workstation\nmanually removed the customProfileDir* directory and all of its contents\nclosed Firefox\nverified that I\'m already using a .jar archive with 3.6 re http://geekswithblogs.net/thomasweller/archive/2010/02/14/making-selenium-1.0.1-work-with-firefox-3.6.aspx\n\nHow can I resolve this?\nHow do you measure quality assurance and quality of products in your teams? What metrics do you use? What tools do you use?\nShould the tester check usability, security, reliability, anything else?\nWhile writing UI automated tests, I\'ve come across situations where test dependency looked like a must. For example, say I have two tests, where the second is dependent on the success of the first. I can add dependency (using TestNG) on the first test so that the second is executed only when the first succeeds.\nBut most programmers (I suppose xUnit users) support independent tests. That is, instead of being dependent on the first test, the second would need to bring the system to the right state before executing. To achieve this, the second test might invoke some common methods which would do the same operations as that of the first.\nThe problem I see with this approach is execution duplication. The first test is executed. Then the "independent" second test is executed (or it could be executed before the first, as there is no order of execution) which would essentially do the same things as the first test in order to bring the system back to a state where the second can be executed. So, this would take more time over all.\nDo you write independent tests? If so, how do you cope up with execution time?\nIn some companies, the testers are expected to do Quality Assurance.\nIn my opinion, this is not the way to go.\nTesters normally don\'t have the mandate to push things thorugh on a higher level.\nBecause of that, it is impossible to perform decent QA.\n\nQA should be done by a QA manager that consults the testers.\n  What do you guys think?\n\nCan every test be done by automation?\nOr is there anything that cannot be done by automation?\n\nis that a feasible idea? \nwhat tools do you use?\nwhat do you call this kind of testing?\n\n\nSimilar to Tools for Server application testing, I\'m looking for Python-related testing tools/software (as Python is my most frequently-used language).\n\nI would like to automate the testing with selenium - even when I am right now a beginner with automatic testing and especially selenium. Therefor I am working with Bromine 3 RC 2. \n\nIs there a way to test an web application each night and send an email with the status of the test? Would you use another tool instead of Bromine 3? What tools do you use in combination with Selenium?\n\n\nI recently asked this question on a less active exchange and as a result didn\'t get the range of opinions I was after so am repeating it here.\n\nI\'ve been working as a tester for the last 6 months (in the UK) and I have just been asked by my employer to work towards the ISEB Certified Tester Foundation Level Book. My main source material is the following book  Click to check book.\nI was hoping that I could get some input from people who have completed this certification in the past. Do you have any sage advice that I should stick to? or any best practices I should adopt while learning the material?\n\nI realize that this certification is unlikely to make me a better tester but it is something the company wants our testers to pursue, so in essence I would appreciate opinions on how to pass the test as quickly as possible.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice to share on how to successfully test BIG ETL or data warehouse applications?\nI have my own ideas of-course, but there only appears to be one main article on line that covers the basics:\n\n\nData completeness. Ensures that all expected data is loaded.\n\nData transformation. Ensures that all data is transformed correctly according to business rules and/or design specifications.\n\nData quality. Ensures that the ETL application correctly rejects, substitutes default values, corrects or ignores and reports invalid data.\n\nPerformance and scalability. Ensures that data loads and queries perform within expected time frames and that the technical architecture is scalable.\n\nIntegration testing. Ensures that the ETL process functions well with other upstream and downstream processes.\n\nUser-acceptance testing. Ensures the solution meets users\' current expectations and anticipates their future expectations.\n\nRegression testing. Ensures existing functionality remains intact each time a new release of code is completed.\n\n\n\nI have heard a lot of "abuse" about automated testing, especially UI bases automated tests. As UI is very fragile and prone to change (especially in agile shops). Personally my automated tests have given more confidence about working system than finding defects. \n\nWhat is your success ratio with automated UI tests? Or maybe how you define success with automated UI test?\n\nI\'ve recently started converting my automation suites from WatiN to Selenium2.  In both cases, I\'ve been using C#.\nAlthough these may seem like simple questions, I\'ve been searching for answers for about 2 weeks with almost no success.\n1) Is there a way to assert that an element exists?  I\'ve had to resort to creating an abject and expecting an exception to be thrown if it doesn\'t exist on the page.  In WatiN, it was as simple as: assert.isTrue(browser.textField(Find.ById(elementId)).exists);\n2) Is there a way to assert that text is present on the page?  I\'ve yet to find a work around for this.  In WatiN, my test would have been: assert.isTrue(browser.containsText("text"));\nThanks in advance.\nI am looking for a test management product to structure our current manual testing. What I would like to it handle is:\n\nrecording of test cases, including parametrised ones;\nhistorical analysis of trends: number of tests, duration, succes criteria;\nability to "feed" test results, e.g. from automatic acceptance tests with Selenium;\nability to open tasks in an issue tracker based on failed testing runs.\n\nThe price tag is obviously important, so free products are preferred. As we are a software company, an architecture which allows us to develop plugins is appreciated.\nHaving a development background, I am convinced that record and replay testing tools have their drawbacks, especially by making tests brittle. See Automated Testing != Record-Playback Tool for a good summary:\n\nRecord-playback scripts are more expensive to maintain because the code they generate is long, complicated, not object oriented and must be further manipulated to put into reusable components.\n\nGiven that a stable framework is offered to QA , is it a reasonable expectation for them to code automated tests? I will obviously assume that they will have at least some programming background.\n\nUpdate: I am interested only in the QA bits specific to automated testing. I am very well aware of the benefits of manual, exploratory testing, but that is out of scope for this question.\nTesting process involves plenty of documentation. How to organize it, so that it is easy to get an information that is needed?\nIs there any major performance difference between the traditional way of finding web elements vs using the page factory pattern?\n\npublic WebElement       username=driver.findElement(username).sendKeys(By.id("username"));\n@FindBy(id="username") public WebElement userName;\n\nWe are looking to move towards DevOps methodology. Currently, we are using Agile methodologies in testing. We, as a team wants to increase the number of deployments/releases in a year. For this, we want to reduce our QA Efforts. We want to create our Automation Scripts for System testing the time, our Developers are creating the UI.\nCan anyone please let us know the path which we should use?\nSelenium IDE gives error "table view is not available with this format" when launched with the new version of FireFox 55.0.3 (64-bit).\n\nWhat I\'m looking for in an answer\n\nConcrete relevant(newer?) examples of why one choice is better than the other\nOR, a concrete suggestion of why using a different language is the better choice over using Javascript to test the live API\n\nI\'m new to Angular and just started a job working on QA for a project with a front end written in Angular.  I\'m planning on writing e2e for the UI in Protractor with Jasmine. I need to write roughly equivalent e2e tests for the API, I know I don\'t want mocking tests (Unit tests will be written in Karma or in the C# back end directly, I\'m still working that out). I want to hit the live endpoints.  \nMy thought was to use Javascript for my testing, to keep the list of languages being used in the product short. I\'ve narrowed down to using either Jasmine with FrisbyJS or Mocha and Chai. I want to choose something that will survive for the foreseeable future, but at the least the next 2 years. \nJasmine and FrisbyJS\nPros:\n\nI\'m using Jasmine already with Protractor/Karma\nFrisbyJS seems easy enough to use once setup\nDoes do testing of live API endpoints easily\nJasmine is an industry standard and will survive long-term\n\nCons:\n\nFrisby seems to have gone through a major rewrite and all tutorials I find are from <= 2015 and before this rewrite that now uses Jest instead of Jasmine-Node to run the tests and the documentation on the github page is just wrong in places and I\'m having to figure out how to run things I don\'t even know how to use yet (I have no issue struggling through learning if it\'s the best choice though!)\nLack of newer examples on how to use the framework\nStill in the middle of rewrite\nUnsure of longevity\n\nMocha and Chai\nPros: \n\nSeem to be a lot of newer tutorials\nDoes do testing of live API endpoints easily\n\nCons: \n\nNot using Jasmine, so new testers will have to learn both Jasmine (which is being using with Protractor for UI) and Mocha (maybe this isn\'t a big deal)\nSeems newer, so unsure of the longevity of the framework/module\n\nSome Background Considerations\n\nI\'ve researched using PostMan or SoapUI for testing of live API (what\'s the term for this too please??) endpoints, but determined I\'m going to have to code regardless, so I\'d prefer to not introduce another language or have to pay for another service when I can make languages I have already work\nI have a lot of experience using Java and TestNG to do live API and UI testing (with a custom wrapper library built around Selenium), so I know what it should look like in general\nI\'m hoping to reach out to someone with more experience in this with an Angular background as I am the QA expert at my position and I have no one here I can physically pester with questions. \n\nI apologize if this is too much an opinion question.  If there\'s another place I should post this please direct me and I\'ll remedy with a removal of this question. \nI am logging in with multiple users simultaneously and performing some tasks. I have used View Result tree listener to store the results. \nHow can I see the result of each login and other scripts per user?\nFor example, the View Result tree listener is showing the result for login 1 to Login n, and showing the same result for each script. I want to see the result in the form login 1 and script 1, login 2 and script 2, and so on.\nCan some one please explain System.setProperty("",""); in simple terms?\nThank You\nI just started my work on month ago as Automation Tester, after I had some training. I feel I am struggling in the work especially as we are only two testers. \nIt is my first job but sometimes I feel I want to quit. If anyone had the same experience, please tell me how long it takes you to get confident and should I quit if I am struggling at work ? I do not want them to let me go.\nLooking For: I want to run Specs in Parallel.\nTried:\nIncluded in config file:\nshardTestFiles : true,\nmaxInstances: 4 \n\nOutput I see:\nMultiple instances are not opening.

Could someone please help me to understand if my approach is correct?\nI have automated tests running on our Continuous Integration machine.\nI have a test failing because of a commit, but this fail has been considered minor, and some more urgent work was scheduled for this iteration.\nHowever, if this test is failing, all other commits will fail until we fix this particular low-prio bug.\nWhat is the best approach to this situation? Do I change the test for now so it would PASS and then when the bug is fixed it will fail, so we then change the test again?\nAny other idea?\nWe are using Jira bug tracking system and have a custom status workflow configuration. After a Jira ticket is sent to "In Testing" status and assigned to a tester and if this tester confirms a bug is fixed or feature is implemented as requested, this ticket goes into this special "In Automation" status and is kept being assigned to the same tester. "In Automation" status is something we use as an indication that we are planning to write an end-to-end or integration test for it (if we think it\'s worth it and makes sense). \nFrom release to release the amount of tickets sent to automation became bigger than the amount of tickets we automated and resolved. This led to a rather large backlog of tickets in this "In Automation" status (we have them about 330 now). Clearly, we have a problem.\nWhat do you think we should do at this point? And, overall, how do you keep track of what issues have automated tests covering it and what not? \nI am working with Selenium C# .NET.\nWhat I want to accomplish is elegant, extendable page load time logging within my page object architecture. Most new pages are loaded as the result of some action, such as a click on a previous page. The problem is that when an action is performed, the WebDriver does not give control back to the Selenium code until the page has loaded. This causes the reported time elapsed to be much less than it actually is from a user perspective.\nHere is some code that represents what I\'m trying to do.\nclass LoginPage : Page\n{\n    public WelcomePage Login()\n    {\n        EnterUserName();\n        EnterPassword();\n        // Really DON\'T want to start a timer here and then access it in the Page constructor, if possible.\n        ClickContinueButton(); // Performs driver.FindElement(continueButtonLocator).Click();\n        return new WelcomePage();\n    }\n}\n\nclass WelcomePage : Page\n{\n    public override void WaitForLoad()\n    {\n        // Wait until some element exists to indicate page has completely loaded.\n    }\n}\n\nabstract class Page\n{\n    long loadTime;\n\n    // Base constructor\n    // Start a timer, verify page load, and stop the timer.\n    public Page()\n    {\n        // This isn\'t called until the browser loading indicator has stopped.\n        timer = StopWatch.StartNew();\n        WaitForLoad();\n        loadTime = timer.EllapsedMilliseconds;\n    }\n\n    protected abstract void WaitForLoad();\n}\n\nHas anyone else come up with a solution to this problem?\nThe next-best solution I can think of right now is to have a global timer that restarts whenever an action like a click is performed. On the base Page class, I have generic methods for performing those actions, so one of those might look like this:\npublic void ClickElement(By locator)\n{\n    IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(locator);\n    GlobalTimer.Restart();\n    element.Click();\n}\n\nAnd then the Page constructor would just access that after verifying load completion:\npublic Page()\n{\n    WaitForLoad();\n    loadTime = GlobablTimer.EllapsedMilliseconds;\n}\n\nI feel like there has to be a better way of doing this, but I haven\'t come across a well-defined pattern in my searching.\nI have created simple TestNG file with simple code to open chrome browser in IntelliJ IDEA but its throwing below error, please help me.\nMy code:\npublic class Sample{\n\n\n    @Test (priority = 0)\n    public void testCase() throws Exception {\n\n    System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "mypath\\\\chromedriver.exe");\n    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\n    driver.get("https://www.google.co.in/");\n\n    }\n}\n\nAnd below is Error:\n\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:\n  org/openqa/selenium/remote/RenderedRemoteWebElement\nat java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)    at\n  java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:763)   at\n  java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:142)\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClass(URLClassLoader.java:467)     at\n  java.net.URLClassLoader.access$100(URLClassLoader.java:73)    at\n  java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:368)    at\n  java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:362)    at\n  java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)    at\n  java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:361)    at\n  java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)     at\n  sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:335)     at\n  java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357)     at\n  TestCase.Sample.signIn(Sample.java:34)    at\n  sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)   at\n  sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\n    at\n  sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\n    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)     at\n  org.testng.internal.MethodInvocationHelper.invokeMethod(MethodInvocationHelper.java:84)\n    at org.testng.internal.Invoker.invokeMethod(Invoker.java:714)   at\n  org.testng.internal.Invoker.invokeTestMethod(Invoker.java:901)    at\n  org.testng.internal.Invoker.invokeTestMethods(Invoker.java:1231)  at\n  org.testng.internal.TestMethodWorker.invokeTestMethods(TestMethodWorker.java:127)\n    at\n  org.testng.internal.TestMethodWorker.run(TestMethodWorker.java:111)\n    at org.testng.TestRunner.privateRun(TestRunner.java:767)    at\n  org.testng.TestRunner.run(TestRunner.java:617)    at\n  org.testng.SuiteRunner.runTest(SuiteRunner.java:334)  at\n  org.testng.SuiteRunner.runSequentially(SuiteRunner.java:329)  at\n  org.testng.SuiteRunner.privateRun(SuiteRunner.java:291)   at\n  org.testng.SuiteRunner.run(SuiteRunner.java:240)  at\n  org.testng.SuiteRunnerWorker.runSuite(SuiteRunnerWorker.java:52)  at\n  org.testng.SuiteRunnerWorker.run(SuiteRunnerWorker.java:86)   at\n  org.testng.TestNG.runSuitesSequentially(TestNG.java:1224)     at\n  org.testng.TestNG.runSuitesLocally(TestNG.java:1149)  at\n  org.testng.TestNG.run(TestNG.java:1057)   at\n  org.testng.IDEARemoteTestNG.run(IDEARemoteTestNG.java:72)     at\n  org.testng.RemoteTestNGStarter.main(RemoteTestNGStarter.java:123)\n  Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:\n  org.openqa.selenium.remote.RenderedRemoteWebElement   at\n  java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:381)    at\n  java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)     at\n  sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:335)     at\n  java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357)     ... 36 more\n\nIt\'s hard to understand how to handle test scenarios in testlink. we always hearing around,\n - one test scenario may consist of many test cases \n - one test case may include in many test scenarios (test case reusability).\nin testlink, how we manage test scenarios?\nI am working on an application that has been written in AngularJS. I only recently joined this company, so was not involved in the design or writing of the application as it currently stands.\nThe development team are looking to integrate automated testing into the development methodology/ life cycle, and I have been given the task of researching testing frameworks that we could look to implement/ use with our code.\nI have been following the Jasmine/ Karma tutorial at https://scotch.io/tutorials/testing-angularjs-with-jasmine-and-karma-part-2, for setting up Jasmine/ Karma as the testing suite for an AngularJS app, and while it does seem to provide some useful tools/ methods for testing the code, and could certainly be useful, I haven\'t come across anything in the tutorial that indicates that it\'s possible to use this framework to simulate user interaction with the front end, and test the application\'s responses to user interaction... which is what we are specifically looking to automate.\nAll of the tests that the tutorial runs through with you seem to be for testing the logic of the code written- none of them seem to test for user interaction with the front end (the web elements).\nThe reason we\'re looking to automate this testing is because as we add new features/ fix bugs & role the versions out to our customers, we will need to test everything on the front end every time, to ensure that none of the changes we\'ve made have broken anything that our clients are using/ will need to use. It would save us a huge amount of time and effort if we could just run a batch of scripts against every version of the software we release, to test all of the front end elements that haven\'t changed between versions.\nIs there a way that I could use Jasmine/ Karma to do this, or is there another tool that would be better suited to specifically testing the user interaction with the application?\nI use one instance of the browser.\nWhen I run multiple tests, during the first test the browser window is maximized. At the start of the second test, the browser window size changes to the default size. At the start of the third test, the window is maximized and at the start of the fourth test, window size changes to the default size...etc.\nThis occurred when using the latest version of WebDriver - GeckoDriver 0.18.0.\nWith previous version of WebDriver, the browser window size has remained maximized during all tests.\nAnd I use the latest version of web browser Firefox 55.0.3.\nWith browser Chrome or IE it works well.\nAll test scripts contains driver.Manage().Window.Maximize();\nAny idea why this is happening?\nAnd how to fix it?\nRecently I got Visual studio Enterprises Subscription from my company and I was asked to prepare the system for testing,  With the help of support team somehow I manage to set up the system but during the research, I come across three terms:-\n\nMicrosoft Test Manager(MTM)\nVisual Studio Test Professional\nTeam Foundation Server (TFS)\n\nNow I am confused that in these three, Please explain me the difference between these & how can I use it for END to END Test Process for any general project?\nI\'ve recently stumbled upon this new (at least to me) testing type: Snapshot Testing:\n\nFor Facebook\'s native apps we use a system called \xe2\x80\x9csnapshot testing\xe2\x80\x9d: a snapshot test system that renders UI components, takes a screenshot and subsequently compares a recorded screenshot with changes made by an engineer. If the screenshots don\'t match, there are two possibilities: either the change is unexpected or the screenshot can be updated to the new version of the UI component.\n\nHas anyone tried that? When is this type of testing applicable? Is this a replacement for unit testing or a just a way/style of writing them? Is it only applicable for the UI tests?\nI am working on an AngularJS app, and am looking to add some automated testing to the development life cycle of the project.\nAfter doing a bit of research, and asking on here about what frameworks would be best to use to enable the testing functionality that I require, I have decided to use Protractor as the testing framework for my app.\nI am following the tutorial to try and get Protractor up and running with my application (i.e. with my existing app, not the Super Calculator application that the tutorial references), but am encountering a problem:\nThe way my development environment is set up, is that I am doing all of the development of the AngularJS app on my local Windows machine, and using a Unix VM (running CentOS) to serve my app\'s front-end using grunt.\nI have run through the setup steps in the tutorial, and have all of that set up correctly.

If so, what IP address/ port should I be using? The port that I have Karma set up on is: 9876- should I be using this port, rather than the one from the tutorial (4444)? Or if not, how can I resolve this issue?\nEdit\nWhen running webdriver-manager start, the console shows the following output:\n\n[16:59:26] I/start - java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=C:\\Users...\\chromedriver_2.32.exe -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=C:\\Users...\\geckodriver-v0.19.0.exe -jar C:\\Users...\\selenium-server-standalone-3.5.3.jar -port 4444\n[16:59:26] I/start - seleniumProcess.pid: 11464\n  \'java\' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\n  operable program or batch file.\n  [16:59:27] I/start - Selenium Standalone has exited with code 1\n\nCurrently, we do a lot of things when there is a application build job triggered (the trigger can be manual, or there is a commit to the develop/trunk branch, or there is a Pull Request created or updated). \nThe build itself is a multi-step process which aside from other things does, as a build verification process, the whole test run, static code analysis check and a coverage report analysis. A build would be marked as failed if:\n\nany of the tests failed ("fail first" mode)\nthere is a static code analysis error or warning\ncoverage dropped lower than N% (in our case it\'s 90%)\n\nDo you see any problems in this approach? Is it too strict and can be improved?\n\nFor instance, recently we\'ve got a failed build just because someone did not put a space after a # comment character in a Python module (which is a PEP8 Python code style violation):\n#some_code = "here"\n^ no space here - PEP8 code style violation\n\nSay there is an app (web, mobile etc.). When a backend error occurs, then should the app show the user a summary of the error (and unique error id), without showing any information that could reveal personal info or security issues ?\nI believe that summarized error messages would help developers to debug issues easily versus error messages which only say that something went wrong. \nSo, should all apps have a bug reporting feature (frontend and/or backend) ? As an aside, are there any tools or guidelines for filtering error logs and presenting them to end users ?\nWe are making a mobile application that will be communicating with the backend, which also we are building. Authorization of users and application itself with the backend is going to be made using oAuth2. Besides of testing the obvious cases like wrong user credentials, client id, secret etc. what are good test cases to test oAuth authentication? \nI was trying to find some ideas on the Internet but it wasn\'t much helpful.\nDo you have any experience in this field and can suggest any weak spots? Any things worth to verify?\nI need your suggestions as I am working for the company as software quality assurance engineer and Business analyst so what would be my role all together? \nAny special or alternative role for being specific? Or, should I use both for my further job hunt? \nI\'m currently trying to implement a base for my automated tests based on the page object pattern with Python, Selenium and Behave. \nI\'ve never really worked in a reasonably big QA project, especially with Python, and I was thinking that someone might have some insight into how I would go about structuring my files and folders. \nAre there any certain Pythonic conventions when it comes to naming the folders and where to put everything?\nOur QA team is not a large one, but consists of full or partially remote, full or part time team members which, as it currently stands, live in different countries and in different timezones. \nWe are trying to review each other\'s code, sending pull requests and mention each other as reviewers with me being the end person to merge (unless it is not mine pull request, of course). Ideally, we try to have multiple approves from reviewers, but because most of us are part-time and moreover remote, timing does not work in our favor. \nThis leads to feedback loop being really slow - for instance, one person might ask for this improvement, other, in a couple of hours, might ask for another one. Then, the author of the PR would address the comments, but then one more person arrives and suggests some other improvements.\nWhat would you recommend to improve in this process? Can this idea of having multiple approves from different distributed part-time reviewers work? \nIs there any way to test an app on all devices without purchasing all devices?\nI am working on a project to retrofit "automation" to a legacy project, it\'s a tricky beast, people just want to know what the progress is on it.\nIs there any real way to measure automation progress, other than observing issues caught ?\nI found in different places that, automation with safari can be done in MAC OS as safari is also an Apple product. But, we can download and install safari browser in windows and test there manually.  \nIs there any way or at least way around to write test automation script with ruby, watir-webdriver to run in Safari browser in Windows OS? \nFor example, I just want to open safari browser like other browsers (firefox, chrome, ie) in windows and rest part of the scripts are supposed to run same in all browsers.\n@browser = Watir::Browser.new :safari\n\nHere I have some test cases on Microsoft Test Manager (MTM), and those test case I have to execute on a real iPhone device but when I use Run & Record test of MTM to execute test cases its record my action on windows\nPlease help here to resolve this issue so that I can execute test cases on the real device, and use recording feature of the MTM tool.  \nI\'m trying to setup Jenkins on my laptop to run JMeter scripts.

Please check your Java installation.\nerrorlevel=2\nPress any key to continue . . . \nFinished: SUCCESS\n\nI recently started working on an application that has been written in AngularJS, and have been tasked with setting up automated testing for the app (all of the testing that has been done as part of the development life cycle to date appears to have been done manually).\nI have not used automated testing in any of my previous roles, so this is quite new to me. After doing a bit of research, and asking for recommendations on here as to what the best framework to use would be for this application, I have decided to use Protractor.\nI have gone through the tutorial on their website, to get an understanding for how it works & what it does, etc, and am now looking to start integrating it into the existing application, which I appreciate/ expect will be a bit more complicated than setting up the testing framework/ suite at the start of a project, & building it in parallel with the development of the application, as I will essentially have to go back through the application (and code), and document everything that will need to be tested, how it should be tested, pass/ fail criteria, etc.\nFor now though, I just want to set up a couple of very simple tests to ensure that I have Protractor up and running with my app correctly. I can then look to design & implement the more thorough/ involved tests later, once I have the framework set up.\nI want to set Protractor up for use within my development environment, but am having a bit of difficulty doing this... My environment is:\n\nWindows 10 PC\nUnix VM running CentOS 7\nPython 3.4 running the backend on the VM\nUsing grunt serve to serve the front end on the VM\n\nI am following through the tutorial again, this time trying to apply it to my existing application, so that I can start writing tests for it.\nI have the conf.js file written as indicated in the tutorial:\nexports.config = {\n    framework: \'jasmine\',\n    seleniumAddress: \'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\',\n    specs: [\'spec.js\'],\n    multiCapabilities: {\n        browserName: \'firefox\'\n    }\n}\n\nand have the spec.js file written as indicated in the tutorial, just with the address that the browser should point to set to the local address of my VM:\ndescribe(\'My App\', function() {\n    it(\'should hit the VM hosted site\', function() {\n        browser.get(\'192.168.1.212:8080\');\n\n        //Write tests here\n        //element(by.model(\'toolbar-btn-on\')).sendKeys(\'write first app test\');\n        //element(by.css\n\n        //Test to get app title:\n        expect(browser.getTitle()).toEqual(\'title of my app\');\n    });\n});\n\nThese files, & my whole application repository is stored on a network drive which I have mapped to both my local machine & the VM. \nIf I open a browser on the VM, and browse to localhost:8080/#/pages/login, I am presented with the log in page for my AngularJS app.\nIf I open a browser on my local windows machine, and browse to  192.168.1.212:8080/#/pages/login, I am presented with the same log in page for my AngularJS app, so it is clear that my app is up and running, Python is serving the back end, and Grunt is serving the front end, all working correctly.\nHowever, when I run:\nprotractor conf.js\n\nfrom the command line, as indicated at the end of \'Step 0 - Write a test\' in the tutorial, although the browser opens & closes again very quickly, as the tutorial indicates it should, it states that the output should say:\n\n1 tests, 1 assertion, 0 failures\n\nbut the output in my console actually shows:\n\n[15:16:09] I/launcher - Running 1 instances of WebDriver\n  [15:16:09] I/hosted - Using the selenium server at http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\nStarted\nF\nFailures:\n1) App should hit the VM hosted site\n    Message:\n      Failed: invalid element state: Failed to execute \'replace\' on \'Location\': \'192.168.1.212:8080\' is not a valid URL.\n        (Session info: chrome=60.0.3112.113)\n        (Driver info: chromedriver=2.32.498550 (9dec58e66c31bcc53a9ce3c7226f0c1c5810906a),platform=Windows NT 10.0.15063 x86_64)\n    Stack:\n      InvalidElementStateError: invalid element state: Failed to execute \'replace\' on \'Location\': \'192.168.1.212:8080\' is not a valid URL.\n...\n1 spec, 1 failure\nFinished in 0.121 seconds\n[15:16:16] I/launcher - 0 instance(s) of WebDriver still running\n[15:16:16] I/launcher - chrome #01 failed 1 test(s)\n[15:16:16] I/launcher - overall: 1 failed spec(s)\n[15:16:16] E/launcher - Process exited with error code 1\n\nSo it appears that my test doesn\'t like the fact that I am asking it to \'get\' the browser at the VM\'s IP address (i.e. not my local computer\'s IP address). Is there a reason for this? How can I set Protractor to run my tests against a version of my application that\'s hosted on the VM, rather than a live site, or a version hosted on my local development machine?\nEnabling certain options on a page will generate a link that I need to store. The link is located in the page object file by element(by.css(\'a[href*="link"]\')); I need to figure out how to store either the link located on the page or the link after it is clicked (the same URL). \nSuggestions?\nMotivated by this talk about the accidental unexpected pony dancing on the screen.\nWe currently have a rather rich subset of end-to-end tests for our AngularJS applications. And, we do get a lot of visual/layout/design issues on every single development iteration. Usually, we do not cover this kind of issues with end-to-end tests and testing the fixes manually. The reasoning was always - too hard, too fragile, too expensive to automate.\nIn some cases though, a style of an element or block on a page is really critical for an end-user and it would make sense to have an automated end-to-end test checking it. We try to check the colors, font styles and other CSS properties inside our Protractor tests, but it is still checking only these specific things and not an element or part of a page as a whole. Plus, the assertions themselves are not readable and easy to break, for example:\nexpect(somePage.someElement.getCssValue("background-color")).toEqual("rgba(255, 211, 205, 1)");\n\n\nWe are thinking of adding some sort of a visual component to our tests. Ideally, comparing screenshots of what we expect an element to look like and how it actually looks. But, there are a lot of open questions at this point:\n\nhow reliable can it be - would it depend on the browser, resolution and other parameters of the test machine setup?\nis it possible to integrate with our existing Protractor test codebase or we need a separate specialized tool for that?\ntest result reporting - how would we present the test results?\n\nHave you done something similar and how did you address the above mentioned issues? Was it worth the cost of maintenance?\nWhen I try to run my frisbyjs tests with jest as documented on the github page, I get the following error: \nRangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\n    at String.slice (native)\n    at Object.resolve (path.js:290:29)\n    at resolveConfigPathByTraversing (C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\jest\\node_modules\\jest-config\\build\\resolve_config_path.js:58:54)\n    at resolveConfigPathByTraversing (C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\jest\\node_modules\\jest-config\\build\\resolve_config_path.js:75:10)\n    at resolveConfigPathByTraversing (C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\jest\\node_modules\\jest-config\\build\\resolve_config_path.js:75:10)\n    at resolveConfigPathByTraversing (C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\jest\\node_modules\\jest-config\\build\\resolve_config_path.js:75:10)\n    at resolveConfigPathByTraversing (C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\jest\\node_modules\\jest-config\\build\\resolve_config_path.js:75:10)\n    at resolveConfigPathByTraversing (C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\jest\\node_modules\\jest-config\\build\\resolve_config_path.js:75:10)\n    at resolveConfigPathByTraversing (C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\jest\\node_modules\\jest-config\\build\\resolve_config_path.js:75:10)\n    at resolveConfigPathByTraversing (C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\jest\\node_modules\\jest-config\\build\\resolve_config_path.js:75:10)\n\nI believe I have the correct file structure, using "__tests__" and my test file "api.spec.js" in that folder, but I might have something wrong going on. Disclaimer: I\'m brand new to Javascript and all related knowledge. I previously worked on Java. \nI\'m working on a proof of concept using Frisby with Jasmine to write live API tests.  My current project structure is as follows:\n\n__tests__\n\n\nhelpers\n\n\nenvironment.js\n\napi.spec.js\n\n\nThe file contents are as follows:\nenvironment.js\nmodule.exports = {\n    oneApiUrl: "https://mywebsite.net/",\n    twoApiUrl: "https://myotherwebsite.com/projectpoint/",\n    dashboardProjectsApi: \'api/dashboard/projects/get\',\n    token: \'tokenstringhere\',\n};\n\napi.spec.js\nconst frisby = require(\'frisby\');\nconst environment = require(\'./helpers/environment.js\');\n\n\nfrisby.globalSetup({\n    request: {\n        headers: {\n            \'Authorization\': \'Bearer \' + environment.token,\n        }\n    }\n});\n\ndescribe(\'Dashboard api\', function () {\n    it(\'should return list of projects this user can access\', function (done) {\n        frisby.get(environment.oneApiUrl + environment.dashboardProjectsApi)\n            .expect(\'status\', 200)\n            .done(done);\n    });\n});\n\nI\'m pretty sure it\'s not the test, as this works if I do jasmine-node .\\api.spec.js.  I can go with using jasmine-node, but there\'s benefits to using jest and I would like to know why this isn\'t working. \nI tried Googling the error, but this error typically comes from issues related to a javascript website, doubling up on imports in the html, etc. I don\'t think mine is related to that, as I\'m trying to run the js file like one would run python, with an interpreter.

This is also true for current date/time because it contains time part.\nI\'m confused how to automate this or what approach should be used to automate this.\nIs there a way to you Google PageSpeed to test staging sites?\nCurrently it is not possible to test staging sites with the Google Tool.\nI\'m using ALM to create test cases to cover different customer creation workflows.\nThe challenge is that when you look up a customer, there are at least 20 ways to do so (through name search, CVR, birth date, etc.). \nQuestion: I would like to minimize the number of test cases I need to create in ALM, while still covering all the options to look up a customer. Is there a way to do so?\nCan I create one test case, and test multiple lookup options within the same case?\nI can not get the button to be clicked, however it is working rarely I tried waits such as:\nWebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));\nwait.Until(ExpectedConditions.ElementToBeClickable(ViewBtn)).Click();\n\nit is not even waiting, it goes immediately to the next line of code which means that the button is clickable.\nI also tried to click it using Javascript but it is not working also:\n((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript("arguments[0].click();", ViewBtn); \n\nWhatever I try to use to click the button, it does not work and it does not cause any exceptions to be thrown.\nThis button exists in a table, in every row, and I am clicking a td that contains anchor text inside, originally it is clickable but when I filter the table using a search condition the button stops working, (clicking manually still works)\n// gives count of downloads in download folder.\nthis.getCountOfDownloads = function (fileName,elementToClick) {\n\n    //provides a way to look for filenames matching a certain pattern (in the worst case, you can wait for the *.* - basically, any file to appear)\n    var glob = require("glob");\n    var filesArray = glob.sync("./src/test/javascript/e2e/downloads/"+"*.xlsx");\n\n    console.log("sizee",filesArray.length);\n\n    browser.driver.wait(function () {\n        elementToClick.click();//to download\n\n        if (typeof filesArray !== \'undefined\' && filesArray.length > 0) {\n            // this check is necessary because `glob.sync` can return\n            // an empty list, which will be considered as a valid output\n            // making the wait to end.\n\n            return filesArray;\n        }\n    }, 4444).then(function (filesArray) {\n        console.log("sizee",filesArray[0]);\n\n\n\n        // now we have the filename and can do whatever we want\n    });\n    browser.sleep(5555); console.log("sizee",filesArray.length);\n};\n\nelemtclick downloads file.\nI can see in intelj when I click sync button.\nAt first it is empty. Then I run this and it shows size as 0 at both console output. Then in next run, it becomes 1 because the file downloaded before. filesarray> 0 is not becoming true.\nI put browser.sleep() after element.click() but it still does not wait for file or does not sync with it.\nWhat I want to do is:\n\nI get the counts of downloading before the operation\nI get the counts after downloaded\nI expect count = currentcount - 1\n\nBut it cannot see the file, why?\nI think I have to refresh the session but maybe there is an another way.\nI am new in selenium.i am trying for the database testing in selenium webdriver using eclipse.\ni have install mysql 6.3 server and configure ojdbc14.jar and mysql-connector-java-5.1.25.jar in eclipse\nplease help me for how to perform databse testing?\nThe flat file has millions of records and the source query is joining at least 10 tables.\nThe Testing I have done is:\n\nStructure validation of the file. Like name & number of fields, delimiter, naming convention, Header or Trailer records.\nCheck for duplicate records.\nSelect one row from the target file and for that record alone, run the source query and then compare the Source output and the target record in the flat file manually comparing each field one at a time.\nCheck for data truncation.\n\nThe concerns I have is:\n\nI can\'t employ minus approach between source and target because target is in flat file.\nI tried loading data into excel and compare but excel has record limitation and hence not all data can be loaded.\nIn the where clause of the source query outer join is used. How to ensure that data is loaded accordingly.\nIs there a way to automate this testing process.\nThough I have written test cases dedicating one test case for fields sourced from one table. Is there any better approach. Pls provide some samples.\n\nThanks a bunch for reading this through and waiting for the suggestions.\nCurrently i am using C#/Selenium to develop the automated testing framework. To run the tests i developed test fixtures which still use C#/Selenium but are ran with NUnit and are separated from the framework. \nTo prevent validation failure, data duplication, and other pain points we have a test script that is ran during the setup that wipes the local instance database to a clean slate each time a new test is run.\nWe currently use class level form objects to represent data which are passed into the frame work method calls. The issue that arises is duplicate data or duplicate path traversal through the system can happen. To combat this we encapsulate code but this can become unmanageable as even the slightest change in the path traversal of the test(Change in steps) will be different than the encapsulated method.\nTo finalize the question, what methods are used for data control when developing automated test frameworks with Selenium\nHow is regression testing tracked as part of a Sprint? Is it a user story or a task? We always do regression testing as part of a sprint; however, there is question on whether we track as a task attached to one story in JIRA. Or is this a separate user story in each sprint?\nI want to deactivate a particular rule. I am checking my php code.\nEg: This branch\'s code block is the same as the block for the branch\n\nThis is the rule I deactivate\nI go  through quality profile-->then click to the php sonar way -->then click on 64 active rules->then I deactivate that rule. Then I logout and login the same bug is visible in the dashboard...\nHow to deactivate the rule ? Is there any another method ?\nWe are having a strange observation while performance testing our web application which is, even after the load test ends, the heap keeps on increasing, what could be the issue?

If you check gmail or any other application then only 1 recent screen we can find.\nHow to write test cases or is it a good idea to have multiple recent screens for 1 android application?\nShould I raise a question to the development team to have only one recent screen?\nI am excuting a testsuite, which includes around 160 testcases via IE.\nBut the execution hangs after sometime. \nTestcases are simple ones,mostly to check the presence of elements or to get the text of an element.\nIE11\nIEServerdriver:version 3\nWindows 10\n\nI\'m working in a Migration API Testing project also I\'m new to API testing. I have this scenario -\n\nThere are 2 services, Service A and Service B.\nService A has the response like this when I request for data \n{ "firstName":"John", "age":31, "dob":"20-12-1988" }\nService B returns response like\n{ "name":"John", "age":31, "dateOfBirth":"20-12-1988" }\n\nNow, we see the values returned are same but the attribute (in bold) changes. My test is to validate whether the data is received correct with appropriate attribute. I do the same through manual way currently. But there are lots of services to be tested like this. So I thought of using some automation to do the same. I\'m able to fetch the response strings for both the services but not sure how to validate them.\nIs there any solution that you guys can suggest to crack this ? \nWhat are some high level test scenarios/types of testing for a personal cloud desktop application?

I have a pile of bug fixes that the Product Owner would like to release.  These fixes were coded by developers no longer with our company.  When it comes to writing test plans, is it typical to write a test plan for testing a bug fix?  \nRecently my team has been implementing Windows API into our framework and moving away from Selenium. So far I have found many benefits to functional browser testing with Windows API over Selenium. The most significant benefit is the ease of debugging without using a Selenium Driver instance.\nWriting unit tests for specific functionality with our WAPI framework is much easier and quicker than using Selenium. If I am debugging with Selenium and reach an error I have to recreate an instance of the driver, reload the page, and navigate back to the specific web page to continue testing my code. \nI have two questions. The first is, am I going about debugging in Selenium the wrong way and is there an easier way to do it? My second question is, has anyone else noticed this and if so why continue to use Selenium?\nI am looking for the high level general steps performed by a QA Engineer on a scrum team using JIRA and a test management tool like Test Rail.

But, a similar view is expressed in this article.\nNext quote is from here:\n\nWhen compared to Explicit wait, Implicit wait is transparent and\n  uncomplicated. The syntax and approach is simpler than explicit wait.\n  Being easy and simple to apply, implicit wait introduces a few\n  drawbacks as well. It gives rise to the test script execution time as\n  each of the command would be ceased to wait for a stipulated amount of\n  time before resuming the execution.\n\nQuestion:\nIs it a bad practice to use implicit wait? Should one use only explicit wait?\nNote: From the Selenium Documentation, it is clear that one should not use both the waits together. I am asking only about implicit wait.\nI want to click the parent of an element if the text within the child matches a certain string.

The issue I am having, once the list is loaded, the webdriver no longer can find the elements within the list.\nsource code:\n\n<table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" height="100%">\n    <!--\n\n     HEADER \n\n    -->\n    <tbody>\n        <tr></tr>\n        <!--\n\n         CONTENT \n\n        -->\n        <tr>\n            <td valign="top" height="*">\n                <div id="listDetails" style="width: 958px; overflow: auto; border: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221); height: 694px;">\n                    <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0">\n                        <!--\n\n                         BEGIN HEADER \n\n                        -->\n                        <tbody>\n                            <tr style="background: url(../image/msn/table_heading.png) bottom left repeat-x"></tr>\n                            <!--\n\n                             END HEADER \n\n                            -->\n                            <!--\n\n                             BEGIN DATA ROWS \n\n                            -->\n                            <tr class="rowEven" onmouseout="style.backgroundColor=\'\'" onmouseover="style.backgroundColor=\'#FFFFCC\'" style="">\n\n<td nowrap="" align="left" style=" border-bottom: #DDDDDD dotted 1px; color: #666666; cursor:pointer; padding-right: 10px" onclick="openContact (\'l-sf-lead-1f26:0\')"></td>\n\nMy Code:\n    String tableHeader = "//*[@id=\'listDetails\']/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]";\n\n    WebElement emailField = driver.findElement(By.id("login"));\n    WebElement pwField =driver.findElement(By.id("pw"));\n    WebElement loginBtn = driver.findElement(By.id("loginbutton"));\n    //assertTrue("checking site title", driver.getTitle().startsWith("Act-On :: Login"));\n\n    //Logging in -> to new ui.\n    emailField.sendKeys(aoEmailtomcat8);\n    pwField.sendKeys(password);\n    loginBtn.click();\n    Thread.sleep(1000);\n    driver.navigate().to(newUI_URL);\n    Thread.sleep(4000);\n\n    //Clicks on Contacts Menu\n    driver.findElement(By.xpath(contactsMenu)).click();\n    driver.findElement(By.xpath(marketignListMenu)).click();\n    driver.switchTo().frame("content");\n    Thread.sleep(4000);\n\n    //Clicks on List\n    driver.findElement(By.xpath(defaultList)).click();\n    Thread.sleep(1000);\n    driver.findElement(By.xpath(fistItemList)).click();\n    Thread.sleep(3000);\n\n    //Does not locate the element, FAILS!\n    driver.findElement(By.xpath(tableHeader));\n\nI want to validate the maximum character limit of the text field in webdriver/java\nI am asking about what skills should a test engineer with one year test experience have?\nPlease help me to automate the below  scenario through selenium webdriver\nIn Application values are stored in the web table.\nSTID STNAME AGE\n1    Sachin  24\n2    Kumar   25\nand similarly in Database also my data stored in the student table as below\nSTID STNAME AGE\n1    Sachin  24\n2    Kumar   25\nI want to compare the data from the application and database data whether data are matching or not.\nCould you please provide the code for this.\nRegards\nSachin\nCould anyone please give some important differences between KANBAN and SCRUM with respect to testing? \nAny examples are most welcome.\nI\'m about to script performance tests for a system with REST interface. I\'m looking for a performance tool that let me prepare XHR requests dynamically, i.e. simulate what JavaScript application does. For instance, to request a CSRF token from one REST endpoint and include it in a header of a subsequent HTTP request. The tool should also handle cookie-management just like any Web browser does.\nAdditional nice-to-have requirements:\n\nthe tool should allow scripting tests in Java, as most of the team is skilled in Java\n\nSo far I have considered multiple tool but each of them has some drawbacks:\n\nJMeter, apart from nice GUI, provides also an API but it seems quite rusty and cumbersome to use. Also, I\'m not sure if I can define requests dynamically, based on the results of previous request. Does it?\nGrinder is Java framework, but test cases must be scripted in Jython. This requires the team to learn Python and also introduces some incompatibility problems: I had hard time to reuse some existing Python libraries. On the other side, I needed to pay some more attention when casting Java objects into Python. Why, the hack, guys couldn\'t make Java framework with Java test cases?\nGatling has quite intuitive DSL for defining requests programmatically (almost like REST-Assured), but is in Scala. That\'s a cool language but again we\'re not proficient in it.\nI wanted to reuse framework for functional REST tests, REST-Assured, but I\'ve read, it introduces much overhead to the performance tests + I would need to add support for reporting myself.\n\nAny other alternative I missed?\nAfter reading so many answers and forums it makes me confuse. some people says:\nSelenium webdriver is browser automation tool and it has nothing to do with the database.\nAnd some other showing JARs and code that how we can connect selenium to the database and we can test database using selenium webdriver.\nSo I would really like to know that can we do database testing using selenium? If yes then which databases tool it supports like Mysql, SQL server, Oracle...\nAnd if selenium is not suitable for database testing then please recommend to me best tool for database testing.\nI have an xpath: \n//*[@id=\'00QE000000gQ9fv_ACTION_COLUMN\']/a[2]/span\n\nin this xpath 00QE000000gQ9fv is dynamic and _ACTION_COLUMN remains the same.\nI stored 00QE000000gQ9fv in a String variable as recordId i.e:\nString recordId = 00QE000000gQ9fv \n\nNow I want an xpath that contains recordId variable.\nWhen running tests with the NUnit GUI application, is it possible to change the location of where NUnit creates the TestResult.xml file after the test has completed?

If not, what are the more common practices.\n\nFirst a little disclaimer, I\'m not an automator, but I\'m trying to learn.  I\'m trying to maintain code that someone else wrote.  We are using Appium capabilities to launch the APK under test on an emulator and then launching the tests.  The problem is that in our latest build our APK now checks for another APK and if it\'s not installed it will prompt the user to install it.  So now the scripts do not work because I\'m not clicking the \'Install\' or \'Cancel\' button on the install process.  My question is what is the best way to fix this so that my tests aren\'t failing.  I\'m thinking either-\n1.) Install the second SDK before my app has a chance to check for it (I do not need to test that now), I\'m using the scripts for regression of existing functionality\n2.  Have the scripts click the "Install" button.  \nThe problem with #1 is that I don\'t see how to install more than 1 APK using the Android Set Capabilities.  The problem with #2 is that I\'m not sure how to inspect the elements on the install package and click Install?\nSo my question- Can you use setCapabilites to install more than 1 APK or is it possible to use Appium to prompt an install?\nI\'m looking for a new test plan suite. \nI have used TestLink for years and this seems so outdated and slow.\nPrice does not matter, open source, paid, etc.\nWhat I\'m looking for is this:\n\nFast (web based application?)

The isDisplayed() method of WebElement appears to be a logical way to do this, however I would like to understand precisely what this method is doing to determine whether or not an element "is displayed". The javadoc does not shed any light on the inner workings of the method and other information on the web appears to be sparse at best. \nIf anyone could provide a detailed description of how this method works, I would be very grateful.\nI\'ve inherited a collection of desktop applications that currently have (for all intents) no automated test coverage.  Generally speaking, these applications are typically deployed as a suite, installed on different machines, and communicate via a complex, undocumented, and proprietary protocol.  They also communicate with vendors via socket or serial to send/receive data.\nI want to introduce automated integration testing for these applications, but haven\'t found many tools that advertise this feature.  TestComplete offers what they call "distributed testing," but after using it in a free trial I\'m not real impressed with how it works.  It just doesn\'t seem to have this use case in mind.  I\'m still working with SmartBear to see if there\'s something that can simplify what I\'m trying to do.\nMy question: can anyone recommend a tool for testing a suite of applications across multiple machines, assuming that a test on one machine might require an action on another machine?  \nI realize I should test in isolation and simulate/mock the other machines, but the communications between the machines is complicated enough that it\'s a bit of a non-starter for me.  I can revisit this if there aren\'t any great tools for doing this, but it no longer becomes a good integration test in my eyes.  I do intend to simulate the vendors\' data feeds since they are generally simple and there\'s no other option since we don\'t have their software.\nHTML rendering, Javascript and AJAX plays an important role in the development of modern web applications.\nHow significant is JavaScript when designing test cases for a website that uses it? What issues are likely to occur for sites using AJAX?

Am I going wrong some where?\nI\'m in the process of updating document templates for a customer. Part of the documentation template stack are the usual QA items: Requirements (RS), Architecture (ADD), Test Plan (TP) and Test Report (TR).\nThese templates are all manually written Microsoft Word documents (this is a requirement. A management system like EA has not been widely accepted).\nHas anyone found an efficient (low risk of copy&paste errors, preserving IDs between documents, etc) way of using Word 2010 features to allow document item cross-referencing?\n(only within a single document - I\'m not even dreaming of inter-document linking yet)\nFor example, if I could create a requirement as a "figure", and I insert a caption, I get automatic generation of number and title, which can be referenced later (I can cross-reference either the caption number or the caption title, as required). A built-in bonus is that the "List of figures" automatically lists the defined figures (ID and caption).\nRight now I\'m having to create individual bookmarks - 1 for ID (SRS-O-001) and 1 for title (No blue M&Ms allowed), and take care to reference the appropriate bookmark elsewhere in the document.\nIf I use section level (e.g. 3.3.1 No blue M&M\'s) it places an artificial constraint on the document layout (code-smell).\nI have found that these bookmark definitions can be copied from document to document (e.g. RS to ADD) where they can be referenced again (of course, they have to manually maintained during specification change cycles).\nUpdate: It seems like the customer will accept VBA macro code to parse a Word style and generate a table. This opens up the possibility of keeping the requirements and tests (etc) in a database or spreadsheet, and dynamically adding content to the Word documents...\nI am testing a software system that forces users to take action on their data every 60 or 180 days. The users get notified when the due date is approaching or if they have missed one.

Right now I am struggling with how to test this system within a several week test cycle. I can think of two ways to handle this.\n\nHave the system trigger action requests every two or three days instead of 60 or 180. \nBecome friendly with a system administrator who will change the server clock for me when I need it.\n\nAre there other approaches to testing this type of scenario?

I\'ve tried various preferences, like:\n    profile.SetPreference("browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk","application/pdf,application/zip");\nprofile.SetPreference("plugin.disable_full_page_plugin_for_types","application/pdf");\nprofile.SetPreference("extensions.autoDisableScopes", 0);\nprofile.SetPreference("pdfjs.disabled", false);\nprofile.SetPreference("pdfjs.firstRun", false);\n\nBut whatever combination I use either kills the Adobe plugin and pdfjs or gives me a popup asking where to save the PDF. If I manually disable the Adobe plugin, the javascript viewer takes over\nHow can I disable the Adobe plugin, but keep FireFox\'s javascript PDF enabled and access the DOM of the PDF?\nNow that Jmeter has a webdriver sampler, is there anything that regular selenium can do to test a UI, that Jmeter still can\'t?\nFor example, I use Selenium in Java to do things like getting html attributes of an element element.getAttribute("title");\nand waiting for conditions up to a maximum time\nWait<WebDriver> customWait = new FluentWait<WebDriver>(driver)\n           .withTimeout(15L, TimeUnit.SECONDS)\n           .pollingEvery(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)\n           .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);\n\nswitching between windows, and more.\nI\'ve seen some example code for the Webdriver sampler here: http://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/WebDriverSampler/?utm_source=jpgc&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=WebDriverSampler\nBut it doesn\'t show how to accomplish tasks like the above - only how to send keys and click on elements.I can\'t find any documentation online regarding how to use the Webdriver sample to accomplish tasks like the above and others.\nIs it possible to do these using Jmeter\'s webdriver sampler?\nBesides these examples, what are other things you can do in Selenium, which Jmeter\'s webdriver sampler can\'t yet do?\nI\'m currently estimating QA efforts for huge enterprise web portal (about 5k+ hrs DEV efforts / 1.5k hrs QA), based on Liferay / Alfresco platforms / solutions. One of the requirements - 3 interface languages user may switch from any page (place) of the solution.\nSo the question is that simple: is there any common practice to estimate localization testing as percentage of overall functional testing efforts?\nThe following assumptions / aspects are actual as well:\n\n2 of 3 languages are common and do not require any special skills for checking from QA team; the 3rd language is uncommon (however, not TOTALLY different, as e.g. English and Japanese). Any criteria for estimations relating that 3rd language, perhaps x2 / x3 efforts required for localization testing of common language?\nWhich approach is better (or easier to explain) - %% based on overall functional testing efforts OR based on the approximate number of separate web portal pages?\n\nAt the moment the following makes sense for me:\n\n5% of overall testing efforts (i.e. about 75 hrs) for common language localization testing;\nApprox. 10-15%, i.e. about 200 hrs for UNcommon language localization testing.\n\nFor the record - web portal will have about 120-140 different types of pages that should have localized elements.\nAny suggestions / help / ideas / approach (as best - based on real experience / cases) are highly appreciated!\nP.S. no sample link available - it\'s requirements refining stage.\nI run nearly 30-40 test cases twice a day. And everytime some test case fails due to page load time. Infact i have explicitly mentioned Thread.sleep("2000"); wherever i feel it takes more time to load. But still some 5-6 testCases fails. How can i make my selenium to wait until the page loads ?? And what would the below code do ?\ndriver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(4000, TimeUnit.SECONDS); \nWill it wait for 4 seconds everytime or it sets the maximum  time limit to 4 secs . I even tried this but it really slowed my test execution. I need some help.\nSo currently at my company it is common practice to write test case high level steps before implementation. Myself and others find this to be a somewhat wasted effort. I often end up blowing away much of the steps when I write the final draft. \nIn my opinion the final draft is very quick to write once implemented. \nSo my question/problem to solve is, what can we better do with our time during this phase(pre-implementation)? What\'s a more constructive endeavor for this phase? \nMy current suggestion is to map the use case and data/control flow of the requirement being tested. That way writing the test case should be simple later because time was spent understanding the problem.\nWe need to test a web application coded in html and javascript. They decided to use Selenium webdriver + jbehave technology and I am not very familiar with it. \nWhich is the most appropriate book I should acquire in order to get started with selenium webdriver + jbehave?\nI have been running performance tests on an asp.net mvc 4 application  using visual studio 2012 ultimate, the response and the pages per second have been quite high at least when I ran the performance tests with IIS express as the server, but I moved the application to IIS 8\nand the pages per second have been very low, never exceeding 1.x even with very low numbers of virtual users. there any configuration changes I need to apply on IIS?\nOutput caching and Kernel model caching are enabled.\nWe\'ve got Jenkins jobs running Unit Tests, Integration Tests, JMeter Tests, and Selenium Tests.  Given my choice I\'ld keep all these test results forever, but maybe that is excessive.  \n\nHow long does your team keep test results?\nHow far back in history have you found useful?\nHave you run into any performance issues related to keeping too much history?\nDo you archive test results outside of Jenkins?  How?\n\nI am basically from Testing and I know QTP Automation, but now my client is asking to do some analysis and start with pilot project as auotmate the teamcity tests using Selenium.\nBut I am really not aware of Teamcity as well Selinum functionalities, as per the googled info I came to know as Teamcity is Java based application for continuous build integration and Selenium to automate applications using JScript/Java Code.\nPlease some one can clarify this in details, how this will work and how we can start & finish this activity successfully.\nThanks,\nPSR\nI am writing automated tests for my company, and I am doing so from the ground up.  We provide both desktop and web applications to our clients.  After doing a lot of research and testing, I landed on Selenium for the web tests because it seemed easiest and most powerful while still giving me total control over my tests.  For desktop applications, I initially landed on Visual Studio\'s own Coded UI Tests, as it was the only GUI tester that gave consistent results.  However, Selenium uses NUnit and Coded UI tests use Microsoft\'s own test framework.  My question is, is there a framework that I can use to run both web tests and GUI tests?  I\'d prefer to continue to use Selenium if possible.  Most other GUI testing applications I\'ve tried are inconsistent or don\'t allow programming.  I can obviously just bypass the GUI and call our application\'s methods directly, but if there is a way to test the GUI as well, that would be preferred.  Any suggestions that use C# would be particularly appreciated.  \nI\'m using the Selenium IDE to record my initial tests and then export them to c# and then use the webdriver.  Some things that I do from the IDE don\'t export.  \nI am trying to select a State from a drop-down text list.  I don\'t have much background in HTML and am kind of new to C# also (I\'ve programmed for a couple semesters in Java so far, c# for about a month.)  How would I go about selecting a specific state from the dropdown list?  \nWe\'ve setup the Jenkins-performance-plugin to run our JMeter tests automatically.  However we\'ld also like to test the Web UI layer for performance.  We\'ve found tools and websites, but we\'re looking for something more easily automated so we can run it from Jenkins.\nSeleniumIDE Issue  - js alert() is not detected by IDE\nThese steps will reproduce the problem:\n\nOpen http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_alert2 \nClick on the "try it" button\nThe clicking of OK on alert is not captured by IDE\n\nSo my question is somewhat simple. I want to test 2 things\n\nError logging\nServer error page\n\nFor the web platform it\'s somewhat easy to do using fiddler or Charles (I\'m sure there are plenty other tools for that).\nMy question is if there is an easy way for me to do the same for mobile platforms. Is there something special I can do on emulators? If so which?\n\nEdit:\nLyndon pointed me to a blog . To summarize the post it is this:\n\nYou will need Charles or Fiddler. Charles works pretty nicely on a mac (but costs money), Fiddler is free.  \nDevices under test have to be on same WiFi  \nOn the mobile device specify the proxy server to be the machine with Charles or Fiddler  \n\nand voila you now have the same functionality.\nI want to use Selenium Server on Windows 7 with a FirefoxPortable as browser, starting the selenium-server-standalon JAR file. My first attempt was without a profile, just like this:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar \n     -htmlSuite "*firefox C:\\Users\\rplantik\\Portables\\selenium\\FirefoxPortable\\FirefoxPortable.exe" \n      "http://127.0.0.1"    \n      "C:\\Users\\rplantik\\Portables\\selenium\\rest\\testsuite.html" \n      "testresults.html"\n\nThe Jetty server was started, but it crushed after having issued the info message Preparing Firefox profile...\nI found out that there is another portable app, called FirefoxPortable2ndProfile, which allows you to start FirefoxPortable with another than the built-in profile. I therefore downloaded that application, too, and modified the command as follows, to include the path to the different profile: \njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar \n     -firefoxProfileTemplate C:\\Users\\rplantik\\Portables\\selenium\\FirefoxPortable2ndProfile\\Data\\profile \n     -htmlSuite "*firefox C:\\Users\\rplantik\\Portables\\selenium\\FirefoxPortable\\FirefoxPortable.exe" \n      "http://127.0.0.1"    \n      "C:\\Users\\rplantik\\Portables\\selenium\\rest\\testsuite.html" \n      "testresults.html"\n\nNow it seems that the profile was created successfully (Preparing Firefox profile... seems to be executed as intended - for a short moment, the "Firefox" logo pops up), then the message Launching Firefox... appears, and indeed a firefox application is started. \nBut after that, the test suite is not executed. Instead, the browser stays on the default site, and there is no further action until I stop the process in the console.\nHow to use Selenium with Firefox Portable? \nWhat are the pros and cons of putting functional requirements into release/exit/ship criteria? \nI am running a thread of 500 users for an e-application using Jmeter. My Application is deployed on 1 server and DB is deployed on another server.( Java, Tomcat Server and Oracle 11g)\nMy question is how to measure the appropriate results.\nFor instance, whenever tomcat is restarted, at Run1 results are different from Run2 since it take time for Caching and another stuff. Then in Run3 results are more faster.\nPlease suggest which results should be shared or what pre-conditions should be there to judge so.\nI\'m testing an Email system where I would test a set of received emails to see if the received emails actually displayed as expected. \nThis is done for each release of the system. So basically I want to automate this process. When the emails are received, the automated testing process should open each email through the web browser (because emails are typically sent to Gmail account) and validate them.\nAlso in the manual testing process, each email is identified by a string in the email content.\nI\'m a software developer on a VERY small team (read as... me).  I\'m working on a large project, and in a few months think it would be beneficial to have some sort of formal QA process.  I can have some internal user\'s access the website and use it, but end-user testing won\'t stress it the way QA testing does.\nCan anyone recommend any processes or organizations that can help me perform some Ad Hoc QA against this when the time is right?  I apologize in advance if this is the incorrect forum to post this to, I\'m not looking to make this a sales board, just wanted some insight from other QA people on how to go about this, thanks!\nWhat are possible sources of problems when a new certificate is installed. \n\nDifferent browsers accessing the site [ff/chrome/mobile iphone/ mobile android/etc]  \nI don\'t think this matters but what network you test it from?  \n?\n\nOther than #1 I am really not sure what else to test.\nOur  system under test have schema that differs between system versions 1.0 and 2.0: new entities have been added, some have columns added. We used Hibernate to generate Java entities for both schema versions. Then, depending on which version we are testing, we are switching the classpath to those Java entities. This way we can use run the same test cases and use the same DB assertions in both 1.0 testing and 2.0. \nThis approach resolves the problem at runtime. However, at compilation time, we got a problem:\n\nfor entities that are specific only for schema 1.0, tests/assertions for schema 2.0 fail to compile; and vice versa\nfor entities that are common and same for both schema, there is no problem.\n\nIs branching our test cases and test framework in SVN the only approach to this problem? The same way devs branches the system?\nThat will be put additional effort on us to maintain each branch.\nEach of our end-to-end test cases checks two aspects/functionalities of message processing:\n\nWhether the message has been processed correctly (resulted in a correct action of the system).\nWhether information about processing been correctly logged to DB (for further reporting purposes).\n\nWe decided to verify both aspects in a single case, because end-to-end tests takes much time (this is distributed system and message traverse through a number of slower, legacy systems).\nNow, when assertions related to first functionality pass, and for the second will fail, it does not matter. All test cases are marked as failed, so the message sent to the management is that 100% of test cases failed, ignoring the fact, that the latter functionality is less important to our business. This is because wustomers won\'t care having correct reports when processing is incorrect.\nHow would you solve this?\n\nCreate separate test cases for different aspects? (more time to run the tests) OR\nConfigure TestNG to create separate reports for each functionality/group of assertions? (if so, then how?)\n\nUpdate: Having correct reports when processing is incorrect is useful only to us for troubleshooting. That is one another reason why we decided to combine checking both aspects in one test.\nOur DBA is very eager to help us with monitoring DB status. We had recently some problems with buggy deployments scripts (both manual and automated) that set up DB incorrectly or incompletely. So his idea is to have SELECT queries that will check the status of DB to provide quick feedback, e.g.\nSELECT count(*) > 0 FROM user_table;\n\nObviously, many DB problems will be discovered by end-to-end tests, but having a number of tests cases checking directly DB will help us with troubleshooting and shorten the feedback loop.\nI would like to add such DB checks as Jenkins jobs and provide to DBA some way (natural for him) to express such test cases. I found two approaches to do that:\n\nTranslate SQL queries to JUnit tests, e.g. using DBAssert library:\n//Set condition to search record by. \ndbAssert.table("authors").where("id", 123).and("last_name", "Coupland") ; \n\n// assert customers _name_ column equals Douglas value in database.\ndbAssert.assert_column("name", "Douglas");\n\nEmbed SQL queries into bash scripts, as proposed here:\n#!/bin/bash -l\nCHECK=`mysql -u jenkins -ppassword -h 192.168.56.101 -BNe \'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo_db.jobs WHERE depth >= 100\'`\nexit ${CHECK}\n\n\nThe choice will depend on our DBA, obviously. Though, I believe, the second approach is easier as it requires no Java skills.\nAny other ideas?\nHow do you mentally deal with this? For example im testing on a "Virtual" Environment of the customers set up....but a lot of things are simulated either due to not having the equipment etc...\nWhen small issues come back I beat myself up over it.\nHow do I get past the fact that im never going to be able to find everything?\nHow to perform Selenium navigation before tests run without using JUnit 4.11+\'s setUp or at the start of the test method?\nWe\'ve got both navigation and bookmark based Selenium tests.  The test code for the page under test is in a separate method that is called by test methods ending in either Bookmark or Nav.  Navigation to the page under test is called from the setUp method, but exceptions that occur when navigating don\'t get treated as test failures because they are running in setUp.  An easy solution that we don\'t like would be adding a call to the navigation method as the first line of each Nav test.  Is there an alterantive way to handle our navigation?\nI am new to automation testing and was looking for guidance on how I can mock or create a simulator for a IVR ( automated call system ).\nWe have an application, which sends some user data to a third party software. This third party makes a call on our behalf to user and asks a few question. Then it sends details about the response from the user in a CSV file in a shared sftp location. \nTo test our system, I was looking to bypass this third party completely and create a fake system but I am not sure how one can fake a call. \nPresently how we manually test is we create an user, send our own phone number so that we can get a call and answer them according to the test cases. Based on our test case we see whether we got the expected result back in csv. \nDoes any one has any better way of doing this and save time in manual process.\nIts complicated, and I might not have explained it properly.  So if you have any questions, I will try to explain it in more detail.\nI am looking into ways of managing my automated tests through some kind of framework or management tool. While there is a lot of software that does the grunt work, such as Selenium, CodedUI etc, I am interested in views on tools to actually manage the tests, execute and report results back.\nDoing some Google\'ing I have come across the following - can anyone give me any views from their experience? Are there any other recommendations?\n\nAXE - http://www.axetest.com\nRobot Framework - code.google.com/p/robotframework/\nCirro Framework - http://www.cirrotest.com\nRanorex - www.ranorex.com\nQA Complete - www.testcomplete.com\n\nAny advice appreciated.\nHow to aggregate similar test failures in Jenkins?\nWe use Jenkins and every once in a while we\'ll get hundreds (700+ at the moment) of failures when testing against Oracle.  Most of them are a generic failure during startup failures, finding the ones that aren\'t is challenging to do manually (700+) links to click on.  We\'d like some way for the same type failures to be aggregated so we can easily see the ones that aren\'t all the same.\nWe are using eclipse luna 4.4.1, adb is installed on linux system to test android app.\nI have recorded a monkeytalk script.

It works fine in Chrome but I need it to work in FF.  Currently using FF 37 and Selenium 2.45.  My code:\n    driver.switchTo().defaultContent();\n    driver.switchTo().frame(0);\n    Actions action = new Actions(driver);\n\n    //click \'Content\' button, this will expose the \'New\' button\n    WebElement contentDropDownButton = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath(".//*[@id=\'topPane\']/div[1]/div/*//*//*[text()[contains(.,\'Content\')]]")));\n    action.moveToElement(contentDropDownButton).clickAndHold();\n    action.perform();\n\n    //capture \'New\' in a WebElement and then click and hold on it\n    WebElement newButton = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath(".//*[starts-with(@id, \'fw_dijit_UIPopupMenuItem\')][text()[contains(.,\'New\')]]")));\n    action.moveToElement(newButton).clickAndHold();\n    action.perform();\n\nLike I say, works fine in Chrome.  What would be the best approach to handling this and can someone suggest code?  I don\'t think I actually need to \'click\' or \'hold\' on either of the Content or New buttons as a real interation will work with a simple mouse hover.  I\'m just not sure how to recreate this with webdriver.\nI am new in using selenium web driver. Can you help me which Element should I use?

To make things more readable I am figuring out how to show the test results differently. With xunit, html, or another reporter (I am using Mocha as testframework for Protractor). Any tips are welcome here.\nThe problem: when running test simultaneously on multiple browsers Selenium outputs the used browser and Operating System between the results.\nExample:\n[launcher] Running 13 instances of WebDriver\n\n\n[chrome ANY #1e] \n[chrome ANY #1e] Using the selenium server at http://172.20.20.208:4444/wd/hub/\n[chrome ANY #1e] \n[chrome ANY #1e] \n\nThis makes the output less readably. Plus when I choose to print the results those lines are not put between html tags.\nIs there a way to hide this information?\nOr any other ideas on this?\nI hope this day finds you well.\nI\'m working on an automation suite and I\'ve run into an annoying problem when it comes to switching windows.  I have a script which clicks a button which opens in a new window.  I\'m able to switch to that new window but only intermittently.  Here\'s my code:\n    mainWindowHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();\n    objAdminPage.clickButtonForNewWindow();\n\n    Set<String> handles = driver.getWindowHandles();\n    System.out.println(handles);\n    System.out.println("This is the main handle " + mainWindowHandle);\n\n    for(String winHandle : handles){\n        System.out.println("In the loop " + handles);\n        if(!winHandle.equals(mainWindowHandle)){    \n            driver.switchTo().window(winHandle);    \n            System.out.println(winHandle);\n        }\n    }\n\nThis seems to be the standard way of doing things.  The script saves the current window handle, then gets all handles, loops over them until it finds the one which isn\'t the current window and the driver switches to it.  And this works.....sort of.  Often when I run the script it won\'t switch to the new window, leading to failed tests and badness.  I\'ve scattered sysouts through the code as you can see and I\'ve noticed that on failure I\'m only getting one handle in the handles set, not both.  What seems to be happening is that the system is charging ahead and the set is being created before Selenium can get both handles.\nI\'m able to get this to run reliably if I make a Thread.sleep(1000) call prior to creating the set but I really don\'t like having to do this.  It seems inelegant and I\'ve not seen this being necessary elsewhere.  If anyone has any better solutions or knows why I\'m having to hack the system like this I would greatly appreciate it.\nRunning Selenium 2.45.0 MacOS 10.9.\nMy question might sound very odd to you all but just wondering if this is possible for us.\nOkay so I have written 10 cases for my login page in selenium using C# .net. But they take quite a lot of time to run one by one . SO I was wondering of there is a way that I can run few cases like 3-4 or may be more cases together . Like As I click on Run Selected Test it runs 3 cases together and then 3 and 3 and so on cause right now I have these 10 only but in future these cases might go upto 150 or something. SO just wondering if this is possible.\nAny help will be much appreciated. \nI want to know, which is the best way to run automated and acceptance tests?\nBecause now I have two environments, which are develop and qa, but I don\'t know if the better way to run these tests is during the build of project in develop environment or after deploy in qa environment, Could you give me your opinion about this?\nI\'m facing an issue when application I\'m testing is opening a second level popup (I mean, a popup that rises another popup). I\'m using Selenium for Java, version 2.42.2, with IE Driver.\nMy code currently manages all other flows and single pop ups windows, but when a second level popup appears my webdriver object gets irresponsive and just stuck in any method that try to get invoked. When this happens, I need to manually close the popup window and then driver method continues the execution of invoked method.\nMaybe it worth mentioning, if I call the second popup from the main page (not from another popup) I am able to manage it without problems, so the problem seems to be related with the number of nested windows more than a specific problem for the page.\nTake a look on below code:\nString url = "/example.jsp"\nint counter = 0;\nboolean windowDetected = false;\n\n// Waiting until page with given url gets detected\n// It tries 10 times before it continues\nwhile (counter++ < 10 && !windowDetected) {         \n\n  waitForSeconds(1); // Just invokes Thread.sleep method, \n\n  System.out.println("before getting handlers, iteration " + counter + " of 10");   \n  Set<String> handlers = driver.getWindowHandles();\n  System.out.println("after getting handlers, number of handlers: " + handlers.size());\n\n  for (String handler : handlers) {\n\n    try {\n      System.out.println("Moving to " + handler);\n      driver.switchTo().window(handler);\n    }\n    catch (NoSuchWindowException e) {\n      System.out.println("Window not found, it probably redirected to a different window");\n      break;\n    }\n\n    if (driver.getCurrentUrl().contains(url)) {\n      windowDetected = true;\n      waitForPageLoading(); // It just verify current page status to be completed\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nI am able to position properly the driver in specific window with above code in other application pages, but when having the second level popup it just hangs on line Set handlers = driver.getWindowHandles(); that is the first method called on driver object after popup appeared. Similarly, if I had called another driver method like driver.getPageSource() the same would have happened in that method.\nI am not able to change application structure (my scope is only for testing it), so doing changes in web application code is not an option for me now. I have read on different options like trying Robot class, but I think it will be difficult to implement with more complex pages and difficult to maintain.\nAny idea of how can I solve this issue? Many thanks in advance.\nBest regards,\nAlberto.\nMy first question. I\'m using 2.8.0 where verifyTextPresent is deprecated but I\'m using it because verifyText requires the use of CSS locators and our data changes from time to time. Anyway, these days, I fire Selenium and do the testing as usual. However, it shows a no-match even though the text is present on the web page (and this behaviour is for one page only). What can I do about this?\nHTML:\n<a href="javascript:popupDers(\'02\',\'2014\',\'CULT\',\'454\',\'eng\');">Cultures of Migration\n</a>\n\nSelenium IDE code:\n<tr>\n  <td>open</td>\n  <td>/programscourses/currentcourses</td>\n  <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>verifyTextPresent</td>\n  <td>Cultures of Migration</td>\n  <td></td>\n</tr>\n\nI have currently a python code that should grab a link from google. \nHowever, google uses a somewhat different method to linking. how could I grab the data-href instead of just href. \nthis is the html example of a google link, the code is different when I use firefox.. there is no data-href:\n<a \n href="/url?    sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dongemondcollege.nl%2F&amp;ei=ihIwVdTqKtDYaoSjgMAP&amp;usg=AFQjCNEvpxj60GxhQekQ2qI6QXDP2Vso1g&amp;sig2=DuKoiCbIcI0ncx8D4gnSaA&amp;bvm=bv.91071109,d.bGQ"\n onmousedown="return rwt(this,\'\',\'\',\'\',\'2\',\'AFQjCNEvpxj60GxhQekQ2qI6QXDP2Vso1g\',\'DuKoiCbIcI0ncx8D4gnSaA\',\'0CC0QFjAB\',\'\',\'\',event)"\n data-href="http://www.dongemondcollege.nl/">\n Dongemond College &gt; Algemeen &gt; Home\n</a>\n\nBelow is the Python code that should grab the link\nAny suggestions?\ndef getLinks(source):\n\n    websiteLinks = []\n    for link in source.find_all(\'a\'):\n        url = link.get(\'href\')\n        if url:\n            if \'/search?\' not in url:\n                websiteLinks.append(url)\n    return websiteLinks\n\nI look for a solution to get hardware information about remote servers using java code \nI have one scenario say example In shoppong cart web application , in the ceckout page while selecting the address,I have two drop downs\nwhich are states and city. we needd to select the state and city and need to validate delivery charge based on the state and city\nHere my question is, I am taking the all states with city names together as a pair in a CSV file and I am executing the above said scenario for each pair of state and city.So my doubt is how many max number of records is it capable to do.\nNote: In my current execution it was executing up to max 136 records after that it was terminating the execution and also I am logging the success condition  to console and failure condition to text file.\nMy Enviroment : Selenium webdriver with javascript(node.js) + mocha framework +windows+excel sheet(800)\nI\'m new to Selenium and have searched for a solution for this, but cannot find one.\nI am trying to drill down into a nav containing a collapsable directory tree. The folder nodes\' content starts as an empty div that is populated when their "+" icon is clicked. The problem is that I cannot find anything within the newly populated div. I am using find_element_by_link_text() and have tried find_element_by_partial_link_text() with a fragment. I\'ve even done a find_elements_by_tag_name() and the new elements (anchors) are not listed with those that exist outside of the new div.\nThe entire nav is contained within an iframe - is there a switch_to method that would apply?\nHere is a sanitized example of what the HTML looks like:\n<iframe id="KnownID" ...>\n  <html ...>\n   <body ...>\n    <div id="unknown_id_first_subtree"> ... </div>\n\n    <div id="unknown_id_nth_subtree">\n      <div id="unknown_a">\n       <table> <tbody> <tr> <td width="however wide the indent"></td>\n         <td>\n           <!-- Child nodes begin here -->\n           <div>\n             <table> <tbody> <tr>\n               <td class="treeCell">\n                 <a id="unknown_id"> this toggles the tree node display </a>\n                 <a id="unknown_id">This is the text I know</a>\n               </td> </tr> </tbody>\n             </table>\n           </div>\n           <div id="subtreeContainer_unknown_id">\n               <!-- Empty place holder to hold expanded content -->\n           </div>\n           <!-- Repeat above pattern for each tree entry -->\n         </td>\n       </tr> </tbody> </table>\n      </div>\n    </div>   ... closes out the nth_subtree\n    repeats\n\nThe empty place holder is populated when the node is expanded. I do not know any of the ID\'s when my script runs, all that I know is the text of the link ("This is the text I know").\nThe IDs of the elements are, of course, available at run time, and I can construct the ID of the various elements I need to use by replacing the prefix.\nI was able to find_element_by_xpath the first entry:\n//a[contains(text(),\'A\')]\n\nwith both FirePath and Seleninum. I can find "B" in "A/B" using FirePath with:\n//a[contains(text(),\'A\')]/../../../../../..//div[@id=\'subtreeContainer_$div$fileFolder_div_ff8\']//a[contains(text(),\'B\')]\n\nHowever, that string does not work when I issue it from Selenium using find_elements_by_xpath(). (I use the plural version because several entries match ("A", "A1", "A2") a single left fragment, just look for the one that I want in that list.)\nThe code that I wrote is basically:\nxpath = "//"\nsegments = [ "A", "B", "C", ...]\nfor segment in segments:\n  xpath += "a[contains(text(),\'%s\')]" % segment\n  anchors = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(xpath)\n  subTreeId = None\n  for anchor in anchors:\n    if anchor.text == segment:\n      id = anchor.get_attribute("id")\n      openId = "open" + id\n      find_element_by_id(openId).click()\n      subTreeId = "subTreeId" + id\n      WebDriverWait(driver, 60).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, subTreeId)))\n      xpath += "/../../../../../..//div[@id=\'%s\']//" % subTreeId\n      break\n  if subTreeId is None:\n     fail()\n\nThe first iteration works and opens the first level of sub-tree, however, the second pass fails with this string:\n//a[contains(text(),\'A\')]/../../../../../..//div[@id=\'subtreeContainer_$div$fileFolder_div_ff8\']//a[contains(text(),\'B\')]\n\nwhich is the same as the one above and I can cut-n-paste this string into FirePath and it finds the node (nodes, actually, "B", "B1", "B2", ...) - sorry to repeat myself.\nMy thinking is that when I "click" the "openId" element, Selenium\'s concept of the "current node" changes and so should the xpath, however, I was not able to get that concept to work by not carrying the prior xpath forward (I changed the "+=" to just "=" for the xpath assignment just before the "break".\nThanks (again), I appreciate the help\nWebElement ELR = driver.findElement(By.id("trades-list"));\nList<WebElement> list = driver.findElements(\n  By.xpath("//*[contains(@id,\'trade-summary-92\')]")\n);\n\nString[] tradeId = null; \nfor(int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++ )\n{\n    String str = list.get(i).getAttribute("id");\n    tradeId[i] = str.substring(23);\n    System.out.println(tradeId[i]);\n}\n\nstr will contain following list is the output of String str = list.get(i).getAttribute("id");\n\ntrade-summary-92222 \n  trade-summary-93333\n  trade-summary-94444 \n\nHere I want to print 92222, 93333, 94444 in the string tradeId. \nI am getting the following error message:\n\nException in thread "main" java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException:\n  String index out of range: -4     at java.lang.String.substring(Unknown\n  Source)   at\n  com.traderev.selenium.multipleBrowser.main(multipleBrowser.java:71)\n\nGiven the following overarching purpose (mission statement) for an application:\nIn order to help keep a healthy and refreshing sleep regime, or in order to limit computer-related addictive behaviours, computer users can automatically lock their devices for certain befitting times in a tamper-proof manner. \nWould creating a Gherkin feature or scenario for the user request below (and later implementing it to pass) be unfitting and bloating the app or does this request actually fit under the scope of this app somehow?\nCould you please also provide the option to shut down the device on lockdown, not just lock it. \n\nIf it does fit then how exactly is it linked to the overall value statement?\n\nI am investigating the use of Cucumber in my company, but I will need a good test management tool to store test results, and do reporting.\nCan anyone recommend a test management tool that can work with Cucumber?\n(Note that I have taken a look at What test management tool to manage Cucumber tests?.

But, Start object mapping mode is not clickable. I created test case and added component but I don\'t map with aut(application under test).\nHow to start object mapping mode in Jubula?\nwcf client test\nI am using wcf test client in vs 2010 tools. \nFirst when i started tool, values came with null.\nI want to change value\'s dropdownlist with my default values.\nHow can i do it?\n\nI\'m starting to build a set of simple automated tests. \nI have:\nWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();\ndriver.get("http://www.yahoo.com");\n\nOn the first line (where I instantiate the WebDriver), I am getting the following exception:\nException in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/common/base/Function\n\nWhat have I missed? I know what NoClassDefFoundError means - the class can\'t be found, but I\'m not familiar with the class in question here. I have selenium-java-2.45.0 on my buildpath.\nI have a collection of media item on a web page and all media items have the same class.  The elements do not have IDs.  I do not want use XPath selectors.  When I use class name, it will pick only the first item, but I want click on the second item.\nCurrently I have:\nWebElement ele = wd.findElement(By.className("vfmThumbnail"));\nele.click();\n\nI know there is a difference between assert and verify in Junit; the assert results in a runtime exception, causing test method execution to abort. To overcome this problem, we can have verify which will make test case fail, but allowing test execution to proceed rather than getting aborted.\nI doubt there is any such built in approach in testNG. I do understand that best practices say, there should not be multiple asserts in same test case.\nBut, in practical world, we do come across scenarios where we need to have multiple checkpoints in one test case and we don\'t want our test method to abort because of one check point failure (test execution should proceed despite failure).\nHow can we use a soft assert mechanism, similar to verify, which will not abort test method when there is a checkpoint failure.\nExample:\n@Test(dataProvider = "getMailUrl")\npublic void testMail(email,subject);\nAssert.assertFalse(subject.isEmpty);//1st checkpoint\nAssert.assertNotNull(email); //2nd checkpoint\nAssert.assertEquals(email, "feedback@yoursite.com"); //3rd checkpoint\n\nNow, I want test execution to proceed, even if the 1st checkpoint (validation of subject being not empty) fails. Definitely we will be not be using assert (hard assert). We will need concept of soft assert similar to verify (facilitated by Junit). \nI understand, we have to build a customListener implementing TestNG interfaces or extending existing listeners such as TestListenerAdapter.\nI am still struggling - how can we do this?\nI\'m working in an "Agile" environment and as the developer, I have been asked by QA to write some test cases and to extensively review existing ones. This seems very backwards to me. Am I missing something?\nHow can I loop a different string into the email field, or a variable without actually having to make a list that consist of 100 different emails. For example is there a way i can send money@qa.test to the email field then money1@qa.test and so on.\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException\nimport unittest\nclass CreateAccount(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        global driver\n        driver = webdriver.Firefox()\n        driver.implicitly_wait(10)\n        driver.get("http://www.copy.com")\n        driver.maximize_window()\n\ndef test_main(self):\n    createNewAccount = driver.find_element_by_xpath("/html/body/main/div/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[2]/div[1]/div/div[2]/div[1]/div/form/div[5]/div[1]/a")\n    createNewAccount.click()\n\n    firstName = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//*[@id=\'dom_id_3\']")\n    lastName = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//*[@id=\'dom_id_4\']")\n    emailField = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//*[@id=\'dom_id_5\']")\n    passwordField = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//*[@id=\'dom_id_6\']")\n\n    submitButton = driver.find_element_by_xpath("/html/body/main/div/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[2]/div[1]/div/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/form/button")\n\n    firstName.send_keys("mike")\n    lastName.send_keys("mano")\n    emailField.send_keys("money@qa.test")\n    passwordField.send_keys("test12")\n\n    submitButton.click()\n\n    try:\n       xpath = driver.find_element_by_xpath("/html/body/main/div/article[2]/div[4]/header/div[2]/div/div[4]/a")\n       print("Yeah")\n\n    except NoSuchElementException:\n       print("Failed")\n       raise Exception(NoSuchElementException)\n\n\ndef tearDown(self):\n   driver.quit()\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    unittest.main(warnings=\'ignore\')\n\nI\'ve done a bit of vbscripting in the past to automate tasks as a sys admin and recently I\'ve taken a position in QA and really want to double down on scripting common tasks for repeated tests; both for myself as well to delegate project work to other people and minimize training. ("go here, do this, launch this, tell me what happens.") Most of what needs to be done is setting up tests in a web app and then poking some things on a kiosk and scanning some barcodes.\nI had an ingenious idea convert my scripting from vb to js and use flex my jQuery knowledge so my scripts would be browser agnostic. This doesn\'t work for a couple reasons. You can\'t import js outside of the browser, and jQuery requires a window with a document. I\'ve looked into testing platforms like Selenium as well as PhantomJS/SlimerJS/CasperJS and they all require an installation of some sort. Especially if I want to eventually automate actions on kiosks installations are out of the question. I\'d also prefer avoiding installing on the testers PCs so much that I\'d rather just continue to vbscript for IE.\nCan anyone point me toward a solution I might be overlooking? Perhaps a portable automation app, or vbscript library which won\'t care what browser may be opened when the script is launched?\nThanks!\nI have a a streaming application that I am going to test. I don\'t really know how to do this. Do I need a special plugin (if so, why)?\nWhy is it difficult to record a scenario for streaming a video, and you need a special plugin instead? Why is it difficult to simulate with just recording?\nExamples are HLS or other streaming technologies. \nJMeter web driver is used for measuring performance metrics of browsers, but it requires writing of scripts. Is there any way I could record these scripts?\nJmeter has a webdriver sampler. We have to write the scripts. We have scripts written in opkey, a selenium based tool. Can we integrate both of them. So that we don\'t have to write scripts in jmeter.\nFor one of my uni projects I have to test and compare how different protocols handle audio and video data transfer. So I have protocols like RTP, RTMP and RTSP. What should I do to test them myself and get information about data loss, transfer speed?\nI am searching for fast ways to log into web applications(or start being logged).\nApplications use cookie authentication stored in db that expire after some time. Magic url for login instantly is not allowed option.\nI prefer start being logged into application(without log in every time).

The warning is\n/usr/lib/python3.5/unittest/case.py:600: ResourceWarning: unclosed file <_io.BufferedReader name=\'/tmp/20170926_084744_545761.pdf\'>\n  testMethod()\nThe code I\'m testing (with Mako and Bottle) is:\n  pdf.pdf_export(selected_date=selected_date, values=values, to_pdf_file=to_pdf_file)\n            return static_file(to_pdf_file, root=\'/tmp\', download=filename)\n\nMy test case looks as follows\n # Test is based on assumption of having the appropriate parameters for the expected output\n    def testPDFexportByLogic(self):\n        filter = \'\'\n        sortby = \'1\'\n        reverse1 = \'1\'\n        reverse = True\n        if reverse1 == \'-1\': reverse = False\n\n        oncall_logic = OncallLogic(self.resources, view_type=OncallViewType.daily)\n        oncall_logic.set_selections(selected_customer_id=\'417\', listing_customer_ids=\'417\',\n                                    selected_date=\'20170925\')\n        pdf_file = oncall_logic.get_oncall_pdf_export_daily_events(self.resources, \'417\',\n                                                                   \'417\', \'20170925\', filter=filter,\n                                                                   sortby=int(sortby), reverse=reverse)\n\n        filename = \'pdf-temp\'\n        with open(filename, \'wb\') as w:\n            w.write(pdf_file.body.read())\n        self.assertIn("Sjukhus", str(self.convert_pdf_to_txt(filename)))\n        os.remove(filename)\n\nThe above test succeeds to render the PDF and check the text, but I get a warning from running the test. Is the warning from the actual test or from running the code which is tested? Which file is it that I must close, if any?\nI restructure the code and I still get the warning. I still get the ResourceWarning. I don\'t understand it because I only open one file and the warning is about the other file. Why???\ndef testPDFexportByLogic(self):\n\n    filename = \'pdf-temp\'\n    with open(filename, \'wb\') as w:\n        oncall_logic = OncallLogic(self.resources, view_type=OncallViewType.daily)\n        oncall_logic.set_selections(selected_customer_id=\'417\', listing_customer_ids=\'417\',\n                                    selected_date=\'20170925\')\n        pdf_file = oncall_logic.get_oncall_pdf_export_daily_events(self.resources, \'417\',\n                                                                   \'417\', \'20170925\')\n        w.write(pdf_file.body.read())\n        w.close()\n        self.assertIn("Sjukhus", str(self.convert_pdf_to_txt(filename)))\n\nThese are my import statements in the test code:\nimport os\nimport io\nimport pdfminer\n\nfrom controllers.oncall import oncall\nfrom pdfminer.pdfinterp import PDFResourceManager, PDFPageInterpreter\nfrom pdfminer.converter import TextConverter\nfrom pdfminer.layout import LAParams\nfrom pdfminer.pdfpage import PDFPage\nfrom business.logic.oncall.oncall_logic import OncallLogic\nfrom business.resources.entities.gui.gui_settings import OncallViewType\n\nThe following is more code that is tested:\ndef pdf_export(self, selected_date, values, to_pdf_file):\n    """\n     @param selected_date: Date of the view to export\n     @type selected_date: str\n     @param values: Dict with values for the template the write on\n     @type values: dict\n     @param to_pdf_file: Name of the PDF file to write\n     @type to_pdf_file: str\n     """\n    css = \'/srv/http/python.dev/python-common/static_files/css/pdf-export-styles.css\'\n    pdfkit.from_string(render_template("oncall/dayview_pdf_export", values), \'/tmp/\' + to_pdf_file, css=css)\n\nIn one of my test case I hit the rest API using restAssured and the API always returns the response in pure HTML. The returned HTML is basically the source of a valid page. Now I can\'t use webDriver.get(URL); method since I don\'t have a direct URL.\nDoes selenium provide any such method in which I can open the HTML source directly in the browser instead of providing a URL?\nRecently I have changed my job and joined in a startup company for automation. We are 3 members in automation team but I feel the other 2 members are not that much capable to think the coding logic, debug problem and scripting as expected from automation tester.\nI have conducted POC, created the road map and project configuration and integration (maven, TestNG, bitbucket and all) by myself.\nAll time only I have to complete and commit the task listed for automation. While since 1 month, other team members only getting what I have written as they are not sound in it. \nMy queries are :\n\nHow do I deal with this situation. Do I carry on my progress as I am doing right now so once the other team members are used to it then they start with the same?\nOrganization culture is, here you have to show your work there is no time bound. Also my team lead suggested that you can take enough time. No need to  hurry. What should I do?\nIs there some other suggestion so I can use them and continue my work as I want?\n\nI used dependency injection in some projects but I didn\'t fully understand why. I think it is partly to facilitate TDD - if we use dependency injection then many dependencies of the software can be injected/"mocked" and like that we can test them without having the dependency, for instance, an underlying data set that is mocked during the tests instead of supplied as it actually is. \nIs this correct or did I misunderstand?\nI am trying to click on display button in Settings app.\nBut "findElementBy.." statement is not working, Sometimes I get \'nullpointer exception\' or \'no such element exist\' exception and some times test passes without clicking Display button.\n\nI have tried with different application but still the findElementBy... is not working in Win10.\nBut the same piece of code is working, when I run it on the same real device from my Win 7 laptop.\nProject is using following jars:\n\ngson-2.2.2.jar\njava-client-4.1.2.jar\nselenium-server-standalone-3.4.0.jar\nAndroid Development Tool for Eclipse (addon)\nAndroid for Maven Eclipse 1.4.0 (addon)\nAppium Sever (ver: 1.4.13.1)\n\nAppium Code:\n@Test\npublic void Script1() throws Exception{\n\n    DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();\n\n    capabilities.setCapability("automationName", "UiAutomator 2");\n    capabilities.setCapability("platformName", "Android");\n    capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion", "6.0.1");\n    capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "Redmi 3S");\n    capabilities.setCapability("appPackage", "com.android.settings");\n    capabilities.setCapability("appActivity", "com.android.settings.MainSettings");\n\n    AndroidDriver driver = new AndroidDriver(new URL("http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub"), capabilities);\n\n    Thread.sleep(5000); \ndriver.findElementByAndroidUIAutomator("UiSelector().text(\\"Display\\")").click();\n}\n\n}\nAppium Logs:\n\nLaunching Appium server with command: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Appium\\node.exe lib\\server\\main.js --address 127.0.0.1 --port 4723 --platform-name Android --platform-version 23 --automation-name Appium --log-no-color\nwarn: Appium support for versions of node < 0.12 has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

The test currently looks like this:\nit(\'should display the Pages menu\', function() {\n    browser.actions().mouseMove(pagesMenuBtn).perform();\n    browser.pause();\n    expect(pageVarBrowser.isDisplayed()).toBeTruthy();\n    browser.pause();\n    browser.actions().mouseMove(userCircle).perform();\n    browser.pause();\n    expect(pageVarBrowser.isDisplayed()).toBeFalsy();\n});\n\npagesMenuBtn is the menu button that will display a sub-menu listing the rest of the pages of the application when the user hovers the cursor over it- it has been defined with:\nvar pagesMenuBtn = element(by.id(\'.nav-container > model[type=href] > value["#/pages"]\'));\n\npageVarBrowser is one of the buttons that is displayed on the sub-menu shown when hovering the cursor over pagesMenuBtn, and is defined with:\nvar pageVarBrowser = element(by.css(\'.nav-container > model[type=href] > value["#/pages/varbrowser"]\'));\n\nuserCircle is simply another HTML element displayed in a different location on the page (just so that I could move the cursor somewhere off the pagesMenuBtn), and has been defined with:\nvar userCircle = element(by.id(\'icon-user-circle\'));\n\nThis doesn\'t appear to be an issue with the syntax/ logic of the tests I\'ve written/ am writing, but when I currently run my tests with the command protractor conf.js, the script starts up, and starts running through correctly, but when it reaches the above test, I get the following output in the console:\n\nError: Timeout = Async callback was not invoked within timeout specified by jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL. \n\nDoes this mean that my tests have failed because they took too long to execute? If so, how can I fix this? Can I change the \'timeout\' variable to a greater value?\nIn the console where I ran the command protractor conf.js, I get the following error message about the failure:\n\nA Jasmine spec timed out. Resetting the WebDriver Control Flow\nFailures:\n1) MyApp should display the Pages menu\n    Message:\n      Failed: Timed out waiting for asynchronous Angular tasks to finish after 11 seconds.

I removed the calls to browser.pause(); as mentioned in my earlier edit, and then started getting the error message above instead. I suspect that this is due to the location of the element that I\'m trying to find/ the structure of the HTML in which it\'s nested. That HTML is:\n<li data-ng-mouseenter="setMenuTop($event)" ng-show="menu.pages.length > 0 || menu.upages.length > 0 || canCreatePage">\n    <a href="#/pages" id="pagesMenuBtn" target="_self"><i class="ti-layers"></i><span data-i18n="Pages"></span></a>\n        <ul class="text-capitalize">\n            <li ng-repeat="page in menu.pages"><a href="#/{{page.location}}" target="_self"><i class="ti-angle-right"></i><span data-i18n="{{page.title}}"></span></a></li>\n            <li ng-repeat="upage in menu.upages">\n                <div class="nav-menu-divider" data-ng-if="$index === 0"></div>\n                <a href="#/{{upage.location}}" target="_self">\n                    <i class="ti-angle-right"></i><span data-i18n="{{upage.title}}"></span>\n                </a>\n            </li>\n            <li data-ng-show="canCreatePage">\n                <div class="nav-menu-divider"></div>\n                <a href="#/pages/create" target="_self">\n                    <i class="ti-angle-right"></i><span data-i18n="Create Page"></span>\n                </a>\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n</li>\n\nThe element that I\'m trying to get hold of is actually one of the ones created with the line:\n<i class="ti-angle-right"></i><span data-i18n="{{upage.title}}"></span>\n\ninside this block. The element itself is not explicitly written, but is created by the Angular ng-repeat function, as an element in a list... Anyone know how I would get hold of a specific element from within this list?\nI\'m using Jasmine, FrisbyJS, and Jest to create API tests for my team\'s product.  I want to be able to handle when an expect (which I\'m pretty sure Frisby is just using the underlying Jasmine expect) fails. I\'m not expecting it to fail. I don\'t want to use a "toThrow", I\'m not expecting this call to fail.  I just want better error logging when an expect that I expect to pass, fails. \nI would like the line of the failing expect, an expanded error message including a relevant stack trace, and potentially the ability to write my own error message attached, like "The call to projects failed".  Maybe this is a shortcoming with the Frisby module, in which case, how should I handle this from the Jasmine perspective? \nI had this code:\nfrisby.get(environment.ApiUrl + environment.dashboardProjectsApi)\n      .expect(\'status\', 200)\n      .done(done);\n\nAnd I was receiving this very non-descript error that was lacking any further information:\n FAIL  tests\\dashboard.api.spec.js\n  \xe2\x97\x8f Dashboard API \xe2\x80\xba should return a list of projects this user can access\n\n    AssertionError: HTTP status 200 !== 500\n\n      at FrisbySpec.status (node_modules/frisby/src/frisby/expects.js:25:12)\n      at FrisbySpec._addExpect.e (node_modules/frisby/src/frisby/spec.js:408:23)\n      at then (node_modules/frisby/src/frisby/spec.js:299:26)\n      at _fetch._fetch.then (node_modules/frisby/src/frisby/spec.js:231:18)\n      at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:109:7)\n\n  Dashboard API\n    \xc3\x97 should return a list of projects this user can access (289ms)\n\nI have a couple of issues with this: \n\nI\'m getting a stack trace of the expects code in Frisby, not where this code is called in my tests\nI don\'t get an expanded message with the error message or stack trace from the API response\n\nAnd then I made this code, which is better and closer to what I would want to log if any of my expects failed:\nfrisby.get(environment.ApiUrl + environment.dashboardProjectsApi)\n      .expect(\'status\', 200)\n      .then(function (res) {\n          if (res.status != 200) {\n              console.log(res);\n          }\n      })\n      .done(done);\n\nWhich emits a much better message to my console.log:\nconsole.log tests\\dashboard.api.spec.js:19\n    FrisbyResponse {\n      _response: \n       Body {\n         url: \'https://mywebsite.net/api/dashboard/projects/get\',\n         status: 500,\n         statusText: \'Internal Server Error\',\n         headers: Headers { _headers: [Object] },\n         ok: false,\n         body: \n          PassThrough {\n            _readableState: [Object],\n            readable: false,\n            domain: null,\n            _events: [Object],\n            _eventsCount: 3,\n            _maxListeners: undefined,\n            _writableState: [Object],\n            writable: false,\n            allowHalfOpen: true,\n            _transformState: [Object] },\n         bodyUsed: true,\n         size: 0,\n         timeout: 5000,\n         _raw: [ <Buffer ... > ],\n         _abort: false,\n         _bytes: 1900 },\n      _body: \n       { message: \'An error has occurred.\',\n         exceptionMessage: \'Sequence contains no matching element\',\n         exceptionType: \'System.InvalidOperationException\',\n         stackTrace: \' ...\' } }\n\nI have a valid understandable exception message and a stackTrace that I can take back to my developers to further debug.  My issue with this though, has to do a lot of handling to make this raw message into something I want logging (which is maybe what I have to do, but I would think someone would have something helpful out there) and I have to have extra code checking the same status again to verify that "hey, your call failed".  I would expect an easier .ifFailed(/do stuff here/) or something. If there is something obvious I missed, I apologize. I tried to Google "Jasmine error handling" without much success. \nI have below code :\nMobileElement mb = (MobileElement)configuration.driver.findElement(By.className("android.widget.ScrollView"));\nJavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor)configuration.driver;\nHashMap<String, String> scrollObject = new HashMap<>();\nscrollObject.put("direction", "down");\nscrollObject.put("element", ((MobileElement) mb).getId());\nscrollObject.put("text", "Proceed");\n        js.executeScript("mobile: scrollTo", scrollObject);\n\nBut I\'m getting exception \n\nMethod has not yet been implemented (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)\n\nI am using Java-client-5.0.0. \nMy current assignment requires me to test data in a large number of text files ~ 200, usually ranging from 1GB to 20GB.\nThe data is in the same schema with coordinates.\nAs of now, the approach is to load these files in a database (PostgreSQL) and then fire test cases using Python.\nRunning a test on all the files (~80 GB) takes anywhere around 7/8 hours.\nEven though the process is majorly automated, there are few drawbacks, namely a lack of proper reporting and manual intervention.\nI want to optimise and improve this process.\nIs the above approach is the best way of testing data?\nAre there better ways to do this?\nWhat are the approaches you guys use to test data?\nCan data languages like R / Scala be useful for this kind of testing?\nLooking for suggestions and pointers.\nThanks.\nI have a test suite that accesses a URL multiple times and needs to complete a user registration.

Is there a limit to clearing sessions and/or is there a better practice to clearing session storage?\nI\'m looking for  ML usage in performance testing of a software. mainly Regression testing where we run same tests for every release to ensure there is no degradation.\nCan I get some guidance around usage, approach etc.\nWe are going to have a couple of interviews coming up soon for a position in our QA department. The position requires quite a lot of manual testing and a bit of test automation which is going to grow. And, this position is 100% remote (this fact might be critical for this question).\nAside from other activities and topics, we are going to try to pair-test with a candidate during the interview, but let\'s assess the situation from a different perspective.\nWhat are the absolute interview "Don\'ts" for a candidate on a manual tester\'s position (with potential automation in mind)? What are some of the red flags we should pay attention to and be aware of?   \nI just wanted to know What is the Meaning of latency in performance testing?\nHow should I create test cases for complex system that provide usage for multiple roles such: super admin, admin, customer service etc.\nThe capabilities such: create, read, delete and update for specific role.\nI might need simpler format to execute both for manual and automated.\nI think about breakdown the test cases into each roles. But that means i would repeat same steps/cases for roles that doesn\'t have significants difference.\nAny suggestion about test case for multiple roles format would be very appreciated.\nWe\'re developing a web service using Azure and VSTS and I\'d like to run some load tests as part of the CI/CD process.\nHowever, I\'m struggling with being able to set the service url for our various environments as part of the build/release definitions i.e. myservice-dev.azure-api.net, myservice-test.azure-api.net etc\nFor our unit tests I\'m able to declare custom parameters and overrides using the .runsettings file but I don\'t believe I have access to something similar for performance and load tests.\nMy Google-foo has failed me so I\'m worried that I\'m approaching this entirely wrong.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated!\nI don\'t really want to wait until Monday to validate this fix.

Below is the test that needs to happen for the other tests to past successfully\n    it(\'should select a template report\', function() {\n        reports.createTemplateBtn.click();\n        reports.selectTemplate.click();\n        browser.switchTo().activeElement().sendKeys(\'Guest RSVP Status\' + protractor.Key.ENTER);\n        browser.sleep(1000);\n        reports.startBtn.click();\n    });\n\nThe test is clicking a field (Select Template) which then shows a drop-down to type in the type of template to be used. The issue is with sending \'Guest RSVP Status\'. Inconsistently, only portions of the phrase will be sent and cause the rest to error out. Is there a better way to implement Send Keys and/or should sleeps be added? 1/5 times the full text is sent successfully.\nUpdate: slowType errors out below. Sleep is not a function.\nfunction slowType(elm, keys, delay){\n        var action = browser.actions().mouseMove(elm).click();\n        for (var i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {\n            action = action.sendKeys(keys[i]).sleep(delay);\n        }\n        return action.perform();\n    }\n\nI am testing an Android based application. Which is responding slow. Meaning the fetching display late on slow network reception. \nShould I report it or not? I\'m a beginner tester in this organization.  \nA little background - We have a native mobile app- Android and iOS, which has a separate chat module. This chat module has text, video and audio cat facility - very much like WhatsApp. \nThe video/audio chat uses WebSocket protocol for communication. We are using TokBox\'s OpenTok platform to implement this functionality. \nMy question revolves around testing testing the consistency for this chat module and the OpenTok implementation . By consistency, I mean, I want to measure/check how many times user1 and user2 were not able to connect or how many times user1 successfully called but user2 was not able to connect or was not even able to receive the call.\nI had a detailed discussion and research on this but I\'m unable to come to a good tool or a process on how to measure this. Is this something we can do as a part of load testing [which can be done via Jmeter\'s WebSocket plugin . ] or is this something that we should check on a network and packet level. \nA google group discussion thread, mentions some KPI\'s for a chat server, but are these applicable here? \nOn a unit level, I see that Autobahn\'s test suite to be somewhat helpful, but I\'m not sure if it can scaled up for an integration or e2e level. \nSometimes, while testing a web application, the app responds much slower than usual. There could be many reasons for this such as bugs in backend, outage in some of the servers, slow internet on client etc.\nHow do I rule out that internet issues on the client are making the web app seem slow ?\nI would like to perform an end-to-end test where I create some data via a UI and then verify it appears in the appropriate report the following day. The challenge is that the report only updates once per day at any point in time between 12AM and 8AM, so in the worst case I need to wait up to 8 hours from the time I create the data before it shows up on the report.\nThe options I see are:\n\nSchedule the test to run just before 12AM and let it run for up to 8 hours polling the report for the data. This is the most straightforward approach but it doesn\'t fit in well with our CI framework which is geared towards short jobs. I\'ll need to override a couple timeouts just to make this one work, and I\'m not totally comfortable with it because it is such a long period of time for a single process to run a test.\nRun the test in two distinct steps. Step 1 completes after the data is created. Step 2 runs at 8AM and verifies the data from Step 1 appeared. This seems reasonable to me but it will now require my test process to manage durable state. I can imagine several ways to achieve this (a durable queue, file, etc) but they all introduce significant complexity. Do I just need to accept that complexity and store state for tests of this sort? What are some best practices or libraries that tend to be used for this?\n\nNeither of these feel ideal to me, but I do not have a lot of experience in testing of this sort. Are there any better approaches?\nPlease help me on this am trying to locate the element using xpath\n\nWhen writing manual test cases, the test case title used to be something like\n\nTC1: Verify that the user is able to login to facebook and react using\n  heart.\n\nWhen trying to automate the scenario using selenium+ TestNG, how to write meaningful test case titles.\nNote: I believe that in TestNG, the test case name is the same as the method identifier under @test annotation \n//Testcase 1\n  @Test\n  public void VerifyThatUserCanLoginToFaceebookAndReactUsingHeart() {\n   //Writeyourcodehere\n}\n\nIs it permissible to write such long method names or is there a better way to write test case names in TestNG or/and selenium.\nI am trying to retrieve the content of the header and each chapter which is a repetitive structure as you can see below.

Currently the tests are closing the browser after each test class.\nI have many test classes with [Test], but I\'m not using [TestFixture].\nMy class with [OneTimeSetup] is:\n    public class TestBase\n{\n    [SetUp]\n    public void Setup()\n    {\n\n    }\n\n\n    [TearDown]\n    public void TearDown()\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    [OneTimeSetUp]\n    public void OneTimeSetUp()\n    {\n        DriverFactory.CreateInstance();\n        DriverFactory.INSTANCE.Navigate().GoToUrl("https://www.google.com.br");\n    }\n\n    [OneTimeTearDown]\n    public void OneTimeTearDown()\n    {\n        DriverFactory.QuitInstace();\n    }\n}\n\nAnd a test class\nnamespace Tests\n{\n    public class Tests : TestBase\n    {\n        [Test]\n        public void SearchTests()\n        {\n            SearchPageObjects searchPageObjects = new SearchPageObjects();\n\n            searchPageObjects.PreencherBuscar("Tempo em BH");\n            Assert.IsTrue(searchPageObjects.VerificaNomeCidade("Belo Horizonte, MG"));\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nI have this function who scroll an element into view and then click on it:\n    private void iClickOnElement(WebElement element){\n        WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);\n        wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(element));\n\n        String scrollElementIntoMiddle = "var viewPortHeight = Math.max(document.documentElement.clientHeight, window.innerHeight || 0);"\n                + "var elementTop = arguments[0].getBoundingClientRect().top;"\n                + "window.scrollBy(0, elementTop-(viewPortHeight/2));";\n\n        ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript(scrollElementIntoMiddle, element);\n        try {\n            Thread.sleep(500);\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        element.click();\n    }\n\nSince the scroll is "smooth", I added a "sleep()" to make sure the element is actually scrolled into view before I click on it.\nHowever, using the sleep is ugly and I would like to just be able to wait for the scroll to be over before I click on anything. How can I do that?\nI\'m aware of this question but I\'m not good enough with javascript interacting with selenium to make use of it.\nLet\'s say I want to test this function:\nfoo(input){\n   a = bar(input)\n   if(a)\n      return baz(0)\n   return baz(1)\n}\n\n(pseudocode)\n\nI want to test foo in isolation, so i mock bar and baz, but if I mock bar the input becomes irrelevant. Unless the mocks care about their input, but then I\'ll mostly be testing my mockimplentation.\nI also I don\'t want to test internals, but see that the correct input delivers the correct output. If I mock bar, the output only relies on what I\'ve told bar to return in its mock implementations.\nBasically, I\'m making a programme that logs into the krispy kreme site and to test if login was successful, I am searching for a certain web element. I\'m using selenium. \nFor debugging purposes, and also as I may need to use this in future aspects of the program, I am trying to save the Element into a variable and then re-output with Console.WriteLine(), which works fine. When I try to use it in other scenarios e.g. If Statements. I get : cannot convert selenium element to string.\nHow do I convert to a string? and store it in a new string variable.\n\norg.openqa.selenium.firefox.NotConnectedException: Unable to connect\n  to host 127.0.0.1 on port 7055 after 45000 ms.

I\'m looking to a website which have complexity. \nHow do you use a relative xpath inside of a wait.until? \nFor example, the below will work:\nelementA.FindElement(By.Xpath(.//div));\n\nHowever, putting a \'FindElement\' inside of the wait.Until() defeats the purpose of the wait.Until() ... the below code is bad\nWait.Until(elementA.FindElement(By.Xpath(.//div)));\n\nThe wait will no longer occur because the FindElement is inside the wait and inner most nested code gets executed first. So how do you do this? At first I thought I could get the xpath of the ElementA and then append that to the front of the relative XPath (which probably slows down everything) but backing out an XPath from an IWebElement as shown below doesn\'t seem to be very reliable.  \nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/selenium-users/kvGLSzl_GQE\n    protected String getXPath() { \n    String jscript = "function getPathTo(node) {" + \n        "  var stack = [];" + \n        "  while(node.parentNode !== null) {" + \n        "    stack.unshift(node.tagName);" + \n        "    node = node.parentNode;" + \n        "  }" + \n        "  return stack.join(\'/\');" + \n        "}" + \n        "return getPathTo(arguments[0]);"; \n    return (String) driver.executeScript(jscript, webElement); \n} \n\nI\'m looking for suggestions/advice on what tools can help test for performance of Operating Systems (Windows and Mac).

I was \'brought-up\' in what you could call best practices. Then I took my current job. I had a choice between the Java/SOA team, and the ERP team. I was told that joining the ERP team would give me the best insight into how the business operates (not in terms of technology, but in terms of business.) So I went with ERP.\nI found a system with over 4 million lines of "Progress 4GL" code (since renamed to Openedge ABL, because "4GLs sound bad") code, spread out around about 11000 files. The best part is, no file exists more than one folder down. So you have about 50 folders, each with 300-400 files a piece in them. Luckily, many of the files haven\'t been touched in over 7 years, and many of them are deprecated (but we don\'t delete them from version control "just in case." Don\'t even get me started on that one.) So there\'s really only about 1.5 million lines of code we\'d actually have to test. "Only."\nI could go on and on about the poor practices of the system. The bottom line was for years, developers had no option to say no. It was "gimme gimme gimme," combined with a lot of contractors moving in and out. Now, they want to clean up their act.\nOne of the first things I suggested was testing. They said, basically "we\'ve been wanting to do testing for years, but we don\'t really know where to start." The business logic and database access are baked into the UI. (I\'d say GUI, but it\'s not graphical, it\'s on a mainframe. Even the order-entry people telnet in.)\nSo this is pretty much a worst case scenario. Millions of lines of code. Over a billion dollars in annual sales running through the system, so it\'s not going to get a re-write (obviously "it works as it is.") No object orientation. No formal or automated tests. Our testers are also the ones who write the specs (which biases them toward "pushing the project through.")\nI\'m getting pretty desperate. I\'m even willing to write whatever testing frameworks (there isn\'t much for Openedge in open source frameworks) we need on my spare time. I\'m convinced it will pay for itself quite quickly. Where can we start? Has anyone here come across a similar project (even if smaller in scale) and if so, how did you cope with and overcome this?\nUpdate: I\'ve had a chat with my manager, and I have approval to draw up a spec/timeline for creating a test harness. At first, I heard this: "What we really need to do is write some tests." to which I responded "Having tests won\'t really help us if we don\'t have a way to run them. I\'ve been looking into ProUnit (the old name for OEUnit) and think it will work for us." "We should write some tests using it." It took about 10 minutes of repeating this for him to realize it was not as simple as downloading the library and "using it." But, approval to write a spec to create a test harness is a start! Thanks guys for all your input!\nWhen do you decide to stop testing, for me it boils down to -\n\nAllocated time is exhausted\nNo high severity/priority defects are found\n\nAny other pointers which you consider while deciding to stop testing?\nI use Selenium 2 in C# to automate testing of our web sites. When building non-Ajax functionality, using webDriver.FindElement(By.Id("element-id")) to find elements on a page works fine, but when doing jQuery Ajax calls this doesn\'t work because it tries to find the element before the ajax request has finished.\nHow do I tell Selenium to wait until the jQuery Ajax has completed?\nI have a third party check box control in my AUT that QTP does not recognize. Is there a way to have QTP treat it as a regular .NET check box?\nLet\'s say you are a developer (specifically, the team lead) and you want to improve the quality of your company\'s products.  Since you cannot change the whole company, you focus on what you and your fellow developers can do to enhance the quality of the applications you create/maintain. You decide that this can best be done by embracing TDD for class verification and BDD for integration testing.\nSince we are talking about .NET development here, let\'s be specific and use:\n\nMSTEST as a unit testing framework for the TDD\nAs a development house you already use TFS 2010 so the MSTEST solution is a given with its integration of code coverage and test pass validation at check-in.  \nSpecFlow for the BDD\nSpecFlow is more subjective, but I propose it as a BDD tool as it integrates well with VS 2010 and source control, and the gherkin/cucumber syntax is, I think, easier than that of Fitnesse.\n\nMoving from "coding with ad hoc testing, followed by a release to QA" to a "TDD/BDD" approach will save time and money over the life of an application\xe2\x80\x94but, it will extend the time a program spends in development over the ad hoc approach (although arguably the QA time should reduce as QA should then mostly find system test faults rather than those and integration and class bugs devs now find and fix sooner).  \nAssume some minor TDD/BDD projects have already been completed so your company is not overly nervous about the technology, but have yet to "go for it" with a full size project. \nBut in this business, development is a different cost centre from QA, and both are different from support and operations.\nSo, how do you sell the benefit to the company of adopting TDD/BDD to development managers who are held to account for the increased cost (i.e., time) of the development department? \nThis, to me, is all the harder given the benefits of failing early, etc. seem largely unquantifiable.\nHow do you go about winning hearts and minds on the topic?\nIn my firm, we don\'t have testers, exactly. We have analysts who translate business requirements into specifications. (Think the guy from Office Space, except these guys actually provide some value. Kind of.) Because they have an agenda (keeping the people who gave them the requirements happy) they are often lacking in the thoroughness of the testing they do. Sometimes it\'s because they simply hadn\'t considered one portion, but sometimes it\'s where they actively ignore an area because they know if they test it, it will break, or if they test it they wouldn\'t know right or wrong either way.\nThe kicker is, a month from now, I might get a spec that fixes "a bug introduced with project 12345." Well, gosh, I sure did a lot of testing on that, obviously I missed some of it. Now, the development team is the one who takes the flak because they\'re the one who introduced the bug. I for one am willing to admit I don\'t write perfect code, and so are people on my team. But how do you deal with a (biased) testing group that 1) doesn\'t communicate with other testers, and 2) refuses to accept the fact they also missed it in their testing?\nKeep in mind that this is a highly un-idealistic environment. There are some of us who have had it quite good in the past, and would like to bring our department up to speed on best practices. It\'s a slow process, and sometimes we\'re not sure even where to start.\nI\'ve been having to deal with a lot of testing tools lately for testing tasks that should/must be automated.  These include things like performance/load testing, webservice testing, vulnerability scanning, etc.\nAfter experimenting with both the open source and paid types of tools out there, as well as they may work, do not seem to lend themselves to modification to make the work of the individual tester/team easier/make more sense for them.\nDoes anyone have any experience in building any of these tools yourselves in house?  If so, was the pay off worth it?  Many of us are willing to work in our off-work hours in exchange for making our work easier/less of a hassle.  I can see this being of use in some specific circumstances, such as load testing and web service testing as it would be easier to tie into internal resources.\nI am automating web UI tests using Selenium. These tests are written partly in the spirit of Unit tests, that is they try their best to leave the application in the same state in which they found it. For instance, if a test registers a support ticket using the web UI, it is expected to remove it and the end of the test using the web UI.\nCompared to unit tests, these kinds of tests do much more, not in terms of actual code executed or processes triggered, but in terms of tested actions. One such hypothetical test would be:\n\n(Actor 1) register support ticket;\n(Actor 1) comment with initial data;\n(Actor 2) reply with request for more information\n(Actor 1) upload more information\n(Actor 2) comment that issue is fixed\n(Actor 1) close issue\n\nAll of these actions are verified during a test, and should one fail, the application data is inconsistent.\n\nIs there a better way of making end-to-end tests self-contained and idempotent?\n\nTraditionally, structured test, especially long scenarios are commonly written in the step, expected, actual format.\nBehaviour Driven Design replaces this with the style of "Given", "When" "Then",  for example\nGiven a working ATM\nAnd invalid credit card\nWhen the card is inserted\nAnd a cash withdrawl is requested\nThen no cash should be provided\nAnd the card should be retained\nI want to start use BDD on complex scenarios on a project, and the question that I have is: Does this new style of test case work for larger, real world, end-to-end scenarios or is it more appropriate for simpler "atomic" or unit test style test cases?\nI\'m completely new to this stuff, and for what I\'ve seen it takes a while to get used to it.\nI once tried, but felt I was spending way too much time just writing the tests, or just fixing them \'cause a big requirement changed.\nSo what are the advantages?\nWe are using a rich client developed with Flex. We would like to build automated tests to test whole features. I saw a module for Selenium, Flex Monkium, which could do the job.\nDid you try it out? Is it worth it? Do you know another solution?\nIs there a difference between "testing" and "quality assurance"?  If so, what are the main goals of each process?  What are the critical differences?\nHow do you use screen shot capture in selenium tests? If anyone is using, how effective do you find it ?\nHow do you estimate a testing project? What are the things to be take care of while estimating the time for a testing project ?\nIn my team, there are a number of experienced QA people. I work mostly on developing tools to make the QA process easier for these guys, such as developing test automation.\nThe uptake has been slow, maybe due to the fact that these guys are stuck in their ways, and don\'t really understand how test automation can help, and make their jobs easier. \nI\'ve tried presentations/demo\'s etc. to get my point across, all to no avail. I\'ve even spent time automating almost the entire QA process for a simple application, only for the QA lead to use outsourced QA testers to test it!!\nThere\'s buy-in from management, but no mandate to say that automation has to be used.\nHas anyone ever faced a similar situation? Don\'t get me wrong, these guys do a very good job, but I\'m beginning to think that I\'m wasting my time in this company (a large multi-national), and that my time would be best spent looking for another job.\nWe have a TFS 2010 project (MSF Agile v5.0 template) project, the SSRS reports for burndown allow us to specify start and end dates for the current iteration, but the project portals excel charts parts for burndown do not seem to have that option anywhere I can find it.\n\nCan anyone explain how I can configure the portal\'s excel burndown chart to have the begin and end dates I want rather than the defaults?\nThis isn\'t really a question for me anymore, but, out of curiousity and to help a former co-worker.\nBefore moving to Quality Assurance, I led a UAT team.  This team was made up of former users, who didn\'t actually use the systems that they were testing anymore, except for when they were testing it.  This seems odd to me, and I always got push back from the Business on engaging actual users.  Is this common?\nOn to my real question though, how often should UAT be utilized.  Currently, within my organization, UAT is only utilized when changes are made to SOX (Sarbanes\xe2\x80\x93Oxley) impacting applications, and SOX impacting changes made to other applications.  Although I\'d like to involve UAT more often, I receive push back from the business.  I\'d like to start using them for any changes that impact a customer or end user.  What is considered normal for involving User Acceptance Testing?\nI have heard that, when using Selenium, the CSS Locator has better performance than the XPath Locator. \nWhich Locator do you use in your tests? \nHave you seen a great performance improvement when using CSS Locators? \nWere there times when you had to use XPath instead of the corresponding CSS Locator?\nI have largely worked with Selenium for front end automation. Looks like there is great market for QTP in this arena, especially when you could afford commercial tools. \n\nHave you worked with both QTP and Selenium? How have your experiences been with both? Do you find any one better over other?\n\nI have been running into intermittent errors with some java selenium-rc tests which I think are related to a page which has an ajax poll and automatically refreshes when some condition is reached on the server. In this scenario, I have no way of asking selenium to wait for the page to load, and so I run into a bunch of random "Couldn\'t access document.body" errors.\n\nSo, is there some way I can cause selenium to gracefully handle this situation? If not, is there some way I could detect whether the user is selenium from the page\'s javascript, and disable the automatic refresh?\n\nIf it helps at all, the javascript code in the page looks something like...\nvar ajax = new Ajax(url, { \n    update: state,\n    method: \'get\',\n    onComplete: function(message) {\n        if (some_condition) {\n            window.location.replace(unescape(window.location));\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nI am running single purpose performance tests on a daily basis.  Currently, I run each test 3 times and average them out.

There is a front-end, similar to what Amazon is like in that sales are fed through the site(there is no API for doing this). However, the requirement I have is to test the microservices that sit behind the UI which go off to various warehouse management systems.\nThe issue I have is that in order to test each of these services it\'s dependent on data being passed through from the UI. Obviously it\'s fine to do this, but each of these tests will take a while to run; what I\'m interested in is more of the integration behind each of these micro-services, rather than having to worry too much about the API.

How to do that? Can we open that in Eclipse and do updates/Edits on JAR File script?\nI have a situation whereby, say, I have one API which creates an employee(POST); one which then returns the employee(GET) and one which deletes the employee(DELETE).\nI\'ve been using RestSharp/C# to create my API tests which I\'ve found really useful, however I\'m struggling to understand how I\'d create a test like the above where I\'d want to test multiple API\'s as part of the one test so that I can ensure the creation and deletion works as expected. For example, I\'d pass the Name as a parameter from the "create employee" API and ensure it is returned in the GET request.\nIf anyone has any advice or working examples of this, it would be very useful\nSo here\'s the setup, we have tests where we fetch test data from excel sheet and iterate over all the rows within a particular test. So, for example, there are tests that create some user profiles, once they do; there\'s a success message that appears on the next page, our test uses the "findElement.." method to capture that element and get\'s the text to verify that 1) it appears and 2) that the message is correct. Now here\'s the problem, since the test may iterate over and over a lot (because of excel data rows), every so often we notice that the test throws NoSuchElementException while looking for that success message. I was recently told by someone that instantiating that page object class at each iteration would solve this issue. So my main question really is that would instantiating the page object class solve this, or is there something else I\'m missing? Following is a sample of the code (not exact code of course)\n    SuccessPage successPage = new SuccessPage(driver);\n    InputPage inputPage = new InputPage(driver);\n    String successMessage = "";\n    excelSheetData = someCustomMethodThatFetchesDataFromExcel();\n    for (Map<String, String> rows : excelsheetData){\n      inputPage.inputElement1.sendKeys(rows.get("columnName1"));\n      inputPage.inputElement2.sendKeys(rows.get("columnName2"));\n      inputPage.buttonElement.click();\n      wait.until(ExpectedConditions(visibilityOf(successPage.successEle)));\n      successMessage = successPage.successEle.getText();\n      Assert.assertEquals(expectedSuccessMessage, successMessage);\n    }\n\nPage object file look something like this\n    public class SuccessPage {\n    WebDriver driver;\n       public SuccessPage(WebDriver driver){\n          this.driver = driver;\n       }\n    @FindBy("someLogicalName")\n    public WebElement someElement;\n\nSo roughly about 8 out of 10 times the above code works correctly, but those two other times it throws that NoSuchElementException at successMessage = successEle.getText();\nWhat I\'ve been told I should do instead is something like the following\n    SuccessPage successPage;\n    for(....\n      ...\n      //create a wrapper clickSubmitBtn() method that returns the page object.\n      successPage = inputPage.clickSubmitBtn(driver); //this will instantiate the page object.\n      successMessage = successpage.successEle.getText();\n      ... }\n\nSo,\n\nwill this really solve the problem?\nis that a good programming practice, should instantiation be done\nonce before the loop?\n\nWhen I am trying to run the below mentioned Selenium web driver code in IE 11 browser,  I get below error:\n    Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to find element with css selector == #text\\-input\\-what\n\nCode:\n       package com.indeed.tests;\n       import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;\n       import org.openqa.selenium.By;\n       import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\n       import org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver;\n\n    public class IndeedJobSearch {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n    // Call the IE server to invoke IE browser\n        System.setProperty("webdriver.ie.driver","C:\\\\Users\\\\paulso\\\\Desktop\\\\Testing\\\\Automation\\\\Selenium Automation\\\\IEDriverServer_Win32_3.14.0\\\\IEDriverServer.exe");  \n     // Create Internet explorer driver to driver the browser\n        WebDriver driver= new InternetExplorerDriver();\n     // Maximize the window server.\n        driver.manage().window().maximize();\n     // Open Indeed home page\n        driver.get("https://www.indeed.co.uk/");\n        driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n     // Find What field and enter Selenium\n        driver.findElement(By.id("text-input-what")).sendKeys("Selenium");\n        }\n       }\n\nError (Console log):\n    Started InternetExplorerDriver server (32-bit)\n    3.14.0.0\n    Listening on port 8609\n    Only local connections are allowed\n    Sep 20, 2018 11:31:15 AM org.openqa.selenium.remote.ProtocolHandshake createSession\n    INFO: Detected dialect: W3C\n    Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to find element with css selector == #text\\-input\\-what\n    For documentation on this error, please visit: http://seleniumhq.org/exceptions/no_such_element.html\n\nI am using Selenium with Cucumber to automate one web application, But I am stuck at one element which is not working out with the XPaths and link text \nI also applied the implicit and Explicit wait, \nhover mouse functionality using actions driver also \nthere are no iframes involved either\nBut nothing seems to work out.\nCan someone help me with this??\nThis is the web element I need to click and the HTML\nI tried following XPaths: Upon validating on console them point to the web element but on when I using it in the script it throws the exception.\n //a[contains(text(),\'Logout\')\n\n//div[@class=\'pull-right\']/a\n\n//*[@class=\'logout_class curPnt\']\n\nAlso attaching my code snippet \n\nI\'m diving into the world of API testing and coupled with that integration testing. It\'s made me think quite a lot about a few things:\n1) Who would carry out integration tests? The dev or the tester?\n2) What would integration tests entail, given that they are separate to end-to-end tests\n3) Would we generally use mocks/stubs etc for integration.\nAny advice would be great as this concept is causing me some confusion at the moment\nAs I\'m getting more familiar with the RestSharp client library for my API testing I\'m confortable with using it for single API response checks e.g. checking a status code is correct, or that the response body is as expected.\nHowever, I\'m now looking at more complex tests, namely passing parameters from one API to be used in another. Is anyone aware of how this can be done using RestSharp and, if so, an example would be very useful.\nI\'ve provided an example below of something similar I\'ve done in RestAssured(Java) but I\'m now looking to do this using RestSharp and C#\n@Test\npublic void test_ScenarioRetrieveFirstCircuitFor2017SeasonAndGetCountry_ShouldBeAustralia() {\n\n    // First, retrieve the circuit ID for the first circuit of the 2017 season\n    String circuitId = given().\n    when().\n        get("http://ergast.com/api/f1/2017/circuits.json").\n    then().\n        extract().\n        path("MRData.CircuitTable.Circuits.circuitId[0]");\n\n    // Then, retrieve the information known for that circuit and verify it is located in Australia\n    given().\n        pathParam("circuitId",circuitId).\n    when().\n        get("http://ergast.com/api/f1/circuits/{circuitId}.json").\n    then().\n        assertThat().\n        body("MRData.CircuitTable.Circuits.Location[0].country",equalTo("Australia"));\n}\n\nI am trying to get password reset link which is sent to email\nSystem.out.println("Email Number " + (i + 1));\nSystem.out.println("Subject: " + message.getSubject());\nSystem.out.println("From: " + message.getFrom()[0]);\nSystem.out.println("Text: " + message.getContent().toString());\nSystem.out.println("link: " + message.getDescription());\n\nOuput:\nEmail Number 2\nSubject: Welcome to Application\nFrom: abc xyz \nText: javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart@185d8b6\nlink: null\nI often struggle to see the benefit of unit testing, especially in a web app environment that uses a JS frontend and an API + database backend.\nOn both the front and back end, you would typically mock all the network requests and responses. For example on the front end we might click a button that is used to create a new widget which sends the request to the back end which creates the widget and returns a response containing the new widget.\nIn the above scenario we would create our initial unit tests by mocking the actual network requests and just specifying the data that we want sent / received. Everything passes,\xe2\x80\xa6great.\nThen we change something on the backend and will change the backend unit tests accordingly. Once again all our unit tests pass. But the problem is that now our front end tests continue passing even though the back end has changed.\nThis continually makes me question the value of unit testing and reminds me of this:\n\nHow should integration testing be done with decoupled front / back ends? What tools and techniques are advised?\nIf you want specifics,...I generally work with Python and Django back ends coupled with React front ends.\npackage browserhandling;\n\nimport

first time while listening to the interview of the coverage.py maintainer on the Talk Python to Me podcast show.\ncoverage.py has a new feature to track what and how many tests called a specific line in the code. A potential suggested use case for this feature is to look for the lines in the code that have been executed "thousands" of times during a test run indicating that these lines were over-tested and there is a potential to cut down on the number of tests - with a motivation to make a test run faster.\nI\'m a bit confused as I cannot imagine myself deleting tests because of the over-covering specific lines in the application code. Are there any other potential problems of over-testing?\nI am trying to run a java file from selenium using cmd. Just adding libraries means that the java command (in command lines) does not work (javac works, the file is compiled). Does anyone know any hint?\npackage folder;\n\nimport org.openqa.selenium.By;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select;\npublic class fileJava{\n  public static void main(String[] args){\n    System.out.print("Hello World");\n  }\n}\n\n\nI am developing a testing framework for an application at my work and am running in to an issue. I use Selenium 3.0.1, NUnit 3.5.0, NUnit3TestAdapter 3.6.0, and a Selenium Grid instance to run my tests. In order to parallellize my tests properly I instantiate my webdriver instance at the start of each test (in the test itself, not in a setup method). I do this so that if multiple tests try to execute at the same time they are not trying to talk to the same static webdriver. \nI am running in to an issue that when an Assert.IsTrue fails the Driver.Close() method (a wrapper for my driver instance close routine which executes the .Close() method on its own) directly after it does not execute because my code never makes it this far. I understand that this is because the the failing assertion causes the compiler to exit code execution and return a failing test. \nMy issue with this is that when my Driver.Close() method does not close sessions end up hanging on my grid nodes making them unable to effectively execute the next test in line. If I were using a static driver that I could simply pass around I would just execute the Driver.Close() routine in a teardown method however as I am instantiating my drivers at the start of each test this is not possible. \nDoes anyone have a way that given the constraints of my environment I can still kill the browser session on my grid node after an assertion fails on a test (perhaps some arcane way that I am unaware of to pass my instantiated RemoteDriver to a teardown method at the end of each test)?\nMy code is shown below for clarity:\nAn example of a test:\n[Test]\n\npublic void GoToSearchPage()\n{\n    // Create an instance of the RemoteDriver object\n    RemoteDriver remoteDriver = new RemoteDriver("firefox", "WINDOWS", "Hub_Location");\n\n    // Go to the search page\n    SearchPage.GoTo(remoteDriver);\n\n    // Verify that the browser is at the search page\n    Assert.IsTrue(SearchPage.IsAt(remoteDriver), "The web browser is not at the default search page");\n\n    // Close the session\n    remoteDriver.Close();\n}\n\nAn example of my driver.Close method that lives inside the RemoteDriver class:\npublic void Close()\n{\n    // Close the currently open browser and dispose of the currently open instance\n    Instance.Close();\n    Instance.Dispose();\n}\n\nEdit\nBelow is the code implementation of the answer provided by ernie\npublic void GoToSearchPage()\n{\n    // Create an instance of the RemoteDriver object\n    RemoteDriver remoteDriver = new RemoteDriver("chrome", "WINDOWS", "HUB_LOCATION");\n\n    // Go to the search page\n    SearchPage.GoTo(remoteDriver);\n    try\n    {\n        // Verify that the browser is at the search page\n        Assert.IsTrue(SearchPage.IsAt(remoteDriver), "The web browser is not at the default search page");\n    }\n    catch(AssertionException)\n    {\n        // Close the currently open browser session\n        remoteDriver.Close();\n\n        //Fail the test\n        Assert.Fail("The web browser is not at the default search page");\n    }\n\n    // Close the currently open browser session\n    remoteDriver.Close();\n\n}\n\nWhile this solution does introduce some slowness (approximately 2-3 seconds if the catch is activated) this allows me to avoid refactoring the way I implement my driver in order to use a setup or teardown method.\nI am automating a webpage using Selenium but there is one scenario where after clicking on a button, it opens up an Excel sheet.

APIs etc (sort of headless vertical slice development and testing if you will) but where do we draw the line for the boundaries of things we are testing (I know, I know...it depends!) \nShould we employ End-To-End testing or Component style testing? Or both ( and if the latter how do we deal with stuff coming out of test doubles) \nGiven a REST API, which creates commands, to be consumed asynchronously, and a messaging endpoint performing some action based on a command, which all reside in the same Microservice.  To my mind, the boundaries are at the input into the REST api and the output of the messaging endpoint.  \nFrom a Microservice perspective, I can push in a request and get a message out of the back (mocking interactions with nearest neighbours) to get me to an end state in an End to End style test, and have done so.  The drawback with this though is we start to create an hour glass instead of a  testing triangle, If I am to ATDD all features like this. Which is a fair criticism\nA bit of a debate has arisen about not exercising expensive HTTP calls, and messaging or Databases (which is all fair enough), more an End to End style of testing (favoured in GOOS for example) but rather using Component style testing but then this would omit the messaging aspect unless a test double for the messaging was pretty clever.) \nHas anyone got any experience of any approach(es) to take, or considerations.   \n\nI\'m getting following error while executing my code using Selenium Webdriver:\n\n Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.UnsupportedCommandException: POST /session/0c0ee24f-ebbe-4a28-97f6-8339b9778bf8/moveto did not match a known command\n    Build info: version: \'unknown\', revision: \'1969d75\', time: \'2016-10-18 09:43:45 -0700\'\n\nHelp to resolve above error.\nGiven I have written good unit tests for business rule units of a system. Is it still needed to write acceptance tests that target verifying those business rules implementation?\nI am using Appium to automate all my test cases related to IOS device using Java, Logs are currently displayed on Appium app itself. I want to save them in a text file so that i can check error after it finishes tests.\nWhat I had tried:\n1. I tried to use log4j, but it seems working with java console only not Appium.\n2. I tried to use field available in Appium itself, but if i use it Appium do no start and shows undefined error, on research i find nobody uses that feature.\nSo I am not sure if we can do this or not. Any help is appreciated.\nI know rampup has been explained here How to set up Jmeter ramp up time? or https://stackoverflow.com/q/17288545/4675568.  \nBut something bothers me. On my local machine, I\'m trying to do 10000 threads in a 3 seconds rampup time.\nDoes the rampup too short ? Do I need to use a more powerful machine for the load testing ? Do I need to decrease the thread number ?\nBecause in my case, the 10000th thread starts 2min after the first.\nI affirm working on a software testing project for a customer. Due to a tight budget, I am the only one writing code here. \nI am thinking of performing code refactoring at the end of this project, but this will extend my staying for around 5 working days.\nThe customer I am working for knows little about coding, let alone code refactoring.\nAnyone has any experience about how to convince a customer about how important code refactoring is?\nIs it OK to verify business rule components in form of unit tests, or should unit tests only verify the design and low-level structures?\nGiven we have a class that implements a specific business rule, or an entity in terms of DDD, that contain it\'s own business logic. \nWe can create unit tests which can verify the structure of these classes and also create some unit tests with test data for verifying the business rules implementation.\nAre second set of tests for verifying business rules implementation OK to be in unit-test form?\nSuppose I have five test cases out of which three are grouped in "Smoke Testing" and two have not been grouped at all. \nIf I have set priority for all my test cases from 1 to 5, will the cases from smoke testing group be evoked in priority?\n@Test (priority=3, groups={"Smoke Testing"})\np v Test1(){}\n@Test (priority=1, groups={"Smoke Testing"})\np v Test2(){}\n@Test (priority=2, groups={"Smoke Testing"})\np v Test3(){}\n@Test (priority=5)\np v Test4(){}\n@Test (priority=4)\np v Test5(){}\n\nWhat will happen if I want to add another group XYZ and added test cases like:\n@Test (priority=2, groups={"XYZ"})\np v Test6(){}\n@Test (priority=1, groups={"XYZ"})\np v Test7(){}\n\nI have list of icons in a column , & at a time only one is clickable ,\nbut some times icon is not responding/clickable.

Then the server boots up different VMs, one for each browser. Then the server makes full page screenshots, bundles them somehow and presents them to me/the user in some way.\nI have looked into selenium but as far as I have understood it will only be able to handle Browsers that are installed on my OS, correct?\nThe one system I have seen so far that grants what I am looking for is Browsershots, but their code (and documentation) is quite outdated.

It has reasonably good unit, and integration tests.\nWe recently ran into a bug which we had missed. This bug only became apparent as certain business logic only applied after a number of days of a transaction being created. \nWe knew:\n\nEach component worked.\nUser tests passed\nThe system worked fine on day 0\n\nBut not:\n\nOn day x after creation of items a rule would kick in that caused some items to fail.\n\nWe had specific tests for the rule, however we did not catch that it would apply to the items we were creating. These were a new type of item which the rule should not apply to. \nSo in tests everything was fine, and looked fine on production but after some time some users had problems.\nThis would seem a difficult thing to catch before hand. Now I have some tests in place that age the transaction and test that the logic is applied correctly we can stop regressions. But we endeavour to find bugs before production.  \nAre there any approaches that are used in such situations to try to catch things like this as part of a QA process?\nWe are preparing a comparative document for three test tools\n\nSelenium\nTest Complete\nHP Lean FT\n\nHave successfully created a comparative document with lots of comparisons.

I need to learn siteprism using capybara. When I was going through the documentation of siteprism i can\'t relate section with page objects.\nI have implemented annotations and pagefactory. But i cannot relate sections in siteprism with anything in selenium. \nI have a problem when trying to find many elements in a page. Basically i have 20 identical pages, with slightly different data. Think 20 excel sheets. Page 1 50rows, page 2 100 rows, etc.. each row contains link and some data, and i want to find and make a list of all those links. So i go to page 1, get all links, move on to page 2, page 3, then when im at page which contains lots of rows, it (test) freezes, page stays open forever and there are no errors.\nIm pretty sure problem is with FindElements() since this method i use to get links from each sheet/page and it works for ones with fewer elements:\n        List<IWebElement> _links = new List<IWebElement>();\n\n        List<string> links = new List<string>();\n\n        links = d.FindElements(By.PartialLinkText(partialLink)).ToList();\n\n        int i = 0;\n\n        foreach (IWebElement element in _links)\n        {           \n            links.Add(_sellerLinks[i].Get_Attribute("href"));\n            i++;\n        }\n\nIt works flawlessly when there are 10-40 rows, sometimes fail at 70 rows, and can never get past \'sheet\' with 400 rows. If there was problem with code it would fail sooner i think.\nWhat is the limit to FindElements ? Could it fail/freeze and throw no errors ?\nI need to verify a file has been created locally and need to delete this file as well, how do I do it using JavaScript in TestComplete?\nI was trying to automate the UI testing of an application with Intern js. \nBut I am having a problem finding the way to wait until the page is fully loaded.

And read it from there where\n  ever it is necessary."\n\nTest Data\n\nTest data should be separate from the rest of the automation code. The\n  reason is this: if you do not separate your test data, as you add new\n  tests you will duplicate field identifiers and the data to enter. When\n  there is a change to the code, you will have a maintenance nightmare.\n\nAlso, if your test data is in a separate, non-compiled format, it\'s a lot easier for other people to add new tests. If the data format for each type of test is clearly defined, all that\'s needed to add an iteration of a test is to edit a text file and add a new row of data.\nAnybody, please show an example?

But to me both things are important to be monitored. I cannot imagine to have a whole build green, if all tests are skipped.\nIs there a way to mark a build as unstable if at least one test is skipped?\nHow do you use the bugs that you find while testing to get more attention to refactoring and improving the overall code base and re-writing particularly troublesome sections of code that have been proven as buggy, hard-to-maintain or poorly written?\nI would like to store the "FHCS79" out of "Your booking number is FHCS79" in a variable. \nstoreText css=h2 string<br>\necho ${string}\n\nWhat is the smoothest way?\nCurrently am using selenium-java-2.53.0,can you tell me which is the most stable FF version for it.\nThe website I\'m testing has been built with Visual Studio C#.

I\'ve just realized that I don\'t understand how to create an association between a test run and a version of our software. I thought that I could use the "Name" of the test run to capture this detail, but that seems weak. TestLodge does support custom fields and I could create a "Software Version" field, but the fact I need to create a custom field makes me think I\'m approaching this wrong.\nUpdate: I misunderstood the custom fields as they apply to Test Runs; it will add a field to each Test Case in the run, but not a field to the Test Run "container" itself.\nIs there a common approach or best practice to associate a test run with a software version? Do you use the name? Do you create a new Test Plan for each version?\nI have to capture image using webcam and save as profile image.\nBelow is the screenshot of my flash application\n.\nBelow are the steps I have to perform:\n\nClick on allow\nclick on capture\nclick on save\n\nI am trying to automate a minimal form interface using Selenium to capture an element & later Java code.\nBut the challenge is the minimal form has only one input container which is constantly changing and the input container generates dynamic id\'s so finding the element by id name is not possible.\nThe input container cannot be mapped with xpath because xpath also uses the id \neg. //md-select[@id=\'select_15\'].\nwe have a module in our architecture which checks a SFTP(server)directory for new transmitted XML files, validates them against XSD and if successful it takes the XML file from the directory and does something with it.\nMy question is now: What is a good/the best way to tests this module automically.

Now the situation is changed. E.g. many important firms do not extend their CMMI certifications and smaller firms drop their ISO 9001 certification. What software quality assurance frameworks and methodologies are being used today?\nThe Agile method is pervasive and it seems to me that all is based on experience and conventions on individual teams.\nMaybe there is available some report or review about the current situation.

Please suggest a better way to write minimal no of test cases.\nI am looking for a sane way to organize our test scenarios and test plans. We have a quite modular application, which is customized for each customer. What else, each customer has several mutations of the application.\nFor example, imagine a calculator, scientific calculator, programmable calculator and each of those in different languages or numerical systems.\nRight now, we have a separate test plan and list of scenarios for each customer-product combination. But the maintenance is a pain, because each time a feature gets changed, that is present in more products, we have to update several files. However, even some of the core features of the product, which are completely same for 9 customers are behaving differently for another.\nWhat I think, we are missing, is some central document, which would describe all features together and from which we would then generate the test execution plan.\nBut I am not sure how to structure such a document, how to describe the "common features" and "custom specials" so these are maintainable.\nIs there anyone who has used something similar or solved similar problems?\nI am trying to test the performance of a Silverlight application using JMeter. can you please tell me is that possible?

I am planning to write an automated tests for the UI using selenium web drivers in the py.test. I would like to know what is the best architecture (not the code) for designing the whole automation. The structure I am considering is \nFramework level - contains modules for getting the page object, and functions like getItem, logout, login,logging, exceptions, startbrowser, getClickableObject, sendkeysandenter, generate report, waitforresponse, getting and releasing testbeds, loading the webdriver, Global test properties connections or any other generic functions etc\nTests - get the page object, get the item by id, click,sendkeys,verify etc. Basically I want developing the tests to be as simple as possible and anyone can get aboard and write the tests without needing to know the details of implemenation.\nIs this a good way for long term maintenance and ease of writing? Any other suggestions are welcome.\nAdditionally, two more questions.\n\nDo I have to store all the pages (something like page map) statically somewhere to verify the pages are loaded correctly. For example, an enter loads a particular page. My main concern with this way is what if the resultant page change? Does the corresponding test cases have to rewritten again?\nAny action in the UI sends a command to a particular device and changes it properties. The device has a Rest API which returns its properties and this can be used if the changes in the UI is reflected on the device.  Ideally, it would be better if this comparison is made for every test. If this might cause too much overhead, this can be made optional. Any better way to carry on this particular aspect?\n\nI am searching for Jmeter plugin or existing listener for graph result\nI would like to have Graph(s) against elapsed time\nLabel-number of users against elapsed time\nI am not a tester, but SQL Developer.

So what I\'m asking here is that how do I calculate the percentage of the bugs found for that particular test case.\nExample: I have a test case with 10 scenarios and 3 of those failed, of the 3, 2 are majors and 1 is minor. Now I\'m not sure if I can say that 30% of the scenarios failed since those 3 have different severity rating. So how can I summarized this test case and state how many of the scenarios failed in relevance to their severity.\nCurrently I am responsible for test automation and my company develops applications in Node.js. For web applications, I\'m using python and selenium-webdriver.\nIs there any way to integrate the tests (python) in the JS project?\nI confess that it would be easier to automate using webdriverJS, but I see it\'s hard to find resources and most do not use it.\nWhat is the order of test cases execution in Coded UI? I have my test cases created in Coded UI and they all follow a naming convention e.g. _, so my test cases name looks like:\n\n_001_UC_TT01_ShowResults\n_002_UC_TT01_DontShowResults\n_003_UC_TT01_XYZ\n_001_UC_TT02_ShowResults\n_002_UC_TT02_ABC\nand so on...\n\nBut when I execute these test cases from "Test Explorer" toolbar they don\'t run in the provided order. I know I can creat "Ordered Test" in Coded UI, if I want to execute my test cases in a particular order.\nCurrently, I am not facing any issue with execution of test cases but just for sake of my knowledge want to understand how Coded UI picks test cases in Test Explorer for execution.\nI am looking for a tool using which I can do automated testing of REST APIs. I was going through SOAPUI. But as our clients prefer Microsoft products, I would like to know if there are any Microsoft API Automation tools. Any help will be great!\nI have started off my career in manual testing and an automation tool rarely. I would like to concentrate more on automation testing. I believe I have the object-oriented concepts in a good manner. I would like learn JavaScript and JQuery parallely, which can be used in automation scripting. \nI would like to know which automation tool is more powerful in JavaScript and JQuery? \nAlso, I would like to know which tool is more in demand on market today?\nWe\'re working on test code (mainly UI tests with a few different tools). One thing that\'s really stumping me is how to best separate test data from test scripts. By test data, I mean values that get input into the AUT. \nCurrently, I have a bunch of classes that simply contain test data in methods. This almost works but it\'s \n\nnot scalable and \nnot modifiable from outside the test code. \n\nWe\'ve discussed some approaches like keeping data in a test data database, where different data are called when needed by scripts. This is likely the way to go, but I have no idea how to implement it. What are some approaches that others have had success with? I\'d like to have test scripts as agnostic to incoming data as possible.\nEDIT Some more details about these tests: All test data are parameters that are passed from an external source (different classes, xml, database, etc) into the test code. These tests are written in Java.\nThis is my first time here but I have already posted this question on SO. I keep getting solutions for Windows + Java and not for Linux or python for that matter.\nI am using Selenium and Python to automate a file upload application for the past many hours but nothing helpful! \nThe HTML DOM structure for this file upload is an input tag with its type attribute value = \'file\'. I know I can make use of the send_keys. \nThe problem is I am not supposed to use send_keys() (as per the question I am trying to solve). The assumption is there are other ways of doing it.\nCan anyone suggest me alternative ways to upload the file? I do get solutions for windows but not for Linux(Ubuntu). I know there are applications/tools to automate GUI components like AutoIt but there is nothing for Linux close to AutoIt.\nI can say I have done my homework to find a solution. Only after not finding anything useful, I am asking this question, please help! \nAfter two days of continuous trial, I thought it\'s better to ask you folks here. I want to upload a file on my desktop to a remote server. For this I am making use of python and its module requests. I get good help from the internet but even then when I execute my piece of code, I am not able to upload it.\nSo here is the code I have written:\nimport unittest\nfrom Browser import Browser\nfrom selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nimport requests\n\nclass Upload(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        print "Setting up before test case execution..."\n        self.driver = Browser().initialiseBrowser()\n        self.driver.maximize_window()\n\n    def test_Upload(self):\n        self.driver.get("http://www.justcloud.com")\n        self.driver.find_element_by_link_text("Login").click()\n        self.driver.find_element_by_css_selector("input[name=\'email\'][id=\'login-email\']").send_keys("test_usrname")\n        self.driver.find_element_by_css_selector("input[name=\'password\'][id=\'login-password\']").send_keys("test_pswd")\n        self.driver.find_element_by_xpath("//input[@value=\'Login\' and @id=\'login-submit\']").click()\n\n        wait = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 20)\n        wait.until(lambda driver: self.driver.title.startswith(\'Just Cloud\'))\n\n        try:\n            self.driver.find_element_by_xpath("//div[@id=\'not-installed-container\']//span[text()=\'X\']").click()\n        except NoSuchElementException:\n            print "HURDLE dialog did not appear"\n\n        url = "https://upload.backupgrid.net/add"\n        fileToUpload = {\'file\':open(\'/home/pinku/Desktop/Test_Upload.odt\', \'rb\')}\n        print fileToUpload \n        s = requests.Session()\n        s.auth = (\'test_usrname\', \'test_pswd\')\n        response = s.post(url, files=fileToUpload)\n        print response.text\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        driver.close()\n\nPlease help me point out the mistake I might have made in the code above.\n2 days back I had absolutely no clue of the approach to upload a file. I am sure I am very near to this solution. So I request you guys to help me get it. Trust me, I have put a lot of effort to get this done. \nI recently came across a Google Tech Talk during which the speakers seemed to stress that trust in a test suite is crucial to the overall software development process. Here the link.\nCan anyone share their opinion on this? If you agree that trust in a test suite is important, what do you do in your team to build that trust? I thought of asking the devs to sit down & basically code review whatever tests I wrote for the features they originally wrote. However, I\'m not sure if that\'s the best way.\nThanks. \nI have been writing Selenium Browser automated tests and now I would like to begin writing mobile browser automated tests for Android and IPhone.  I am deciding between the Appium framework and the Selenium AndroidDriver and IPhoneDriver.  Does anyone have experience in these frameworks and knows which framework is easier to jump into from Selenium Browser automation?  Also which framework looks to be the most active, supported, and likely to be a good choice for the future development?\nI have a web application which i would like to automate the testing for functional as well as load testing.\nHowever , it has the following features which i feel will hinder the most common automation tools from functioning.\n\nThe web application throws a SSL client authentication prompt in the login page after clicking on Submit button where i need to choose the appropriate certificate for the user to login.\nIn form pages , once again , the form data is signed using an ActiveX control or a firefox addon , which will throw a prompt similar to the SSL client authentication prompt from which the user selects his key to sign the data beofre submitting to the server.\n\nIs it possible to automate the user activity in this application from user login , few page traversals, a form submission with the signing and logout . How can this be done ?[Tools etc].\nIf this is possible , then will i be able to scale this activity to say 100 users at the same time ?\nI know there is an action class where this is possible, but I just understand common keys, such as: enter, backspace, and tab. For instance:\naction.sendKeys (Keys.ENTER).perform();\n\nFor modifier keys---Caps Lock, Control, Option, Command---it is not very clear how to use sendKeys?\nI need to generate a report from the dashboard view of Quality Center to get all the blocking defects in my test sets. Meaning, I want to filter the list of defects that are linked to test instances marked with the status \'blocked.\nCould you please help me in generating such custom report?\nThanks,\nKarim.\nI\'m testing a library that processes queries based on User-Agent.  In my tests, I\'d like to feed it as much strings as possible.\nWhere can I find a public collection of User-Agent strings?\nI\'m mainly interested in "real" strings, but a collection of specifically interesting strings could be of use (like examples that are likely to put stress on parsers).  Plain newline-delimited list is OK.\nI bought Binder\'s "Testing Object-Oriented Systems" book.\nI\'m a technical QA, and wanted to both strengthen my test automation skills and become more thorough. However, I found the book so abstract and difficult to understand, that I cannot make any practical use of it. I though it might be my opinion only but I found there are more similar views of experienced software engineers, so maybe there are objective hurdles to read and "apply" this book.\n\nHow do you read this book?\nWhat problems have you solved thanks to this book? \n\nThere are people here who read this book and recommended it, so I believe the book can be useful in practice. I just need to hear how.\nI\'ve read a lot of technical literature, research papers, documentation so I was expecting this book will be both useful and legible to me. I am used to literature and research papers that are problem-driven. Books that follow a bottom-up approach, where a reader can build his or her own model of solving certain class of problems, by reading about those problems. This particular book does the opposite, so if someone can show me connection between real problems and the theory laid in this book, I might learn or motivate myself to grab for this book again.\nI have a bunch of unittests written in python in which messages (text) of any kind is used. Instead of \'hardcoding\' the text examples used for the tests I would like to use a database of some kind (simple text file, pickle file) which contains such test examples, and which can be extended either manually or automatically very easily. \nIs there a dedicated framework/module available, or do I do this simply on my own and create a simple text file? Maybe there are some best practices available I can follow?\nWe are building an application, which is based on Qt 4.8 on Windows. I have been looking for an automation tool which is cross-platform and should be able to automate my application. I have read a few papers about Linux Desktop Testing Project (LDTP), so I am interested to know whether tool can be of any help to me?\nOur team is responsible for web application testing. We\xe2\x80\x99ve recently faced a question of providing the most common (and what is more important, the most convenient and handy) format of displaying data in a detailed test report: pdf, email, html, excel, word, etc.\nWe would appreciate your sharing your experience and practice of representing detailed test results.\nI am new to testing. I need to learn because I have an opportunity to work in this field in the the future. I would like to know what I need to get started. Preferably, I would like to study automated testing. How much time will it take for someone who only knows a little programming and no testing?\nTools, tutorials, courses (free or YouTube), all information is welcome. In the beginning, I only need to learn the basics, not be an expert.\nI was applying for QA position and the SDET asked me this question: \nHow do you test a backend API? \nIn the interview. \nI wasn\'t sure I answered it correctly. Just wondering if I can get some input from someone.\nIn the past I\'ve used BDD - Cucumber with the Gherkin syntax - for UAT (User Acceptance Testing).  Is this the main area of testing for using Cucumber ?\nMy organization also has the following areas of testing:\n\nunit\nintegration\nsystem integration\nregression\n\nIs it suitable / practical to use BDD for these other areas, or is it only suitable for User Acceptance Testing ?\nI have karma tests that during execution runs PhantomJS.\nUnfortunately, when some of those tests fail, error messages are not very helpful. Thus, I would like to debug them.\nHowever, most sources that I\'ve found suggest creating a separate configuration for debugging - configuration using Chrome (or another modern browser) to debug tests. For example:\nhttps://wannabeegeek.com/2017/04/07/debugging-jasmine-unit-tests-running-with-karma-runner-in-vs-code/\nhttp://blog.mlewandowski.com/Debugging-Karma-tests-with-VSCode.html\nIs it possible to run those tests in debug mode, step-by-step, using breakpoints without changing PhantomJS to Chrome?\nWhen I have dependencies such as http or authenticate, how can I use Cucumber without being slowed down on these services ?\nI am reading a book Testing Object oriented systems, and found the following:\n\nIf a boundary condition uses two or more variables, then on and off\n  points can be found by solving the related equations.

Can you advice which tools can be used to develop Model Based Test in C#. Is it normal to use NModel? Or it\'s obsolet? What tools is used now?\nI work with a business team where no one has been a developer or has studied software engineering. I have been working on their Android App as a QA for the past few months, and I have realized that they have been focusing and judging my performance not on the basis of how much I work and find bugs, but suddenly I am questioned when there is an issue detected by anyone from the business team.\nI have been telling them that 100% tested and bug free product is a myth. But their answer to this fact is "Change your mentality to expect bugs". Of course this is not in a tester mind while testing a product, but this is fact.\nNow I feel that they have made up their mind that my mentality is not correct. \nHow can I work with this group without being judged on an impossible standard?\nI have recently started developing an automated test suite for one of my company\'s products, which has been written in AngularJS, using Protractor as the testing framework (although I have used JavaScript quite a lot in the past, I am new to AngularJS, and have never previously worked on anything that has involved automated testing).\nHaving decided to design & write the tests in as \'modular\' a way as possible, i.e. grouping the tests that are testing similar features/ related elements of the application together, I have started with writing some simple scripts to test the app navigation.\nWhile this has started well, and all of my tests for the first few navigation buttons & pages pass correctly, I ran into an issue when testing the navigation to one particular page: the \'Charts\' page.\nThe issue that I ran into here, is that as soon as the user browses to this page, there is a service running within the app that automatically opens up a dialog to give the user options for creating/ editing a chart. Because this dialog \'overlays\'/ sits on top of the actual page, all of the menu buttons are disabled while the dialog is open, so my test script currently fails, as it can\'t find the menu button to return to the page that it navigated from.\nTo solve this, I want to add a few lines to my test script, that will find the dialog\'s \'Cancel\' button, & click it, before continuing with the rest of the script, but due to how the dialog service has been written, the \'Cancel\' button (& other elements belonging to the dialog) don\'t have id attributes that I would usually use to get hold of them (i.e. doing something like var dialogCancelBtn = element(by.id(\'cancelBtn\'));).\nThere is a DialogMgr service written within the application, which has a closeAll() function that would be useful to call in order to close the dialog, so that the test can continue to run. \nThe DialogMgr has been defined with:\nangular.module(\'app.dlg\')\n// The service provides dialog windows based on the bootstrap Modal service\n.factory(\'DialogMgr\', function ($rootScope, $document, dialogs) {\n\n// A list of active instances of dialogs\nvar dlgs = [];\n\n// Variable to store the loading dialogue\nvar loadingDlg;\n\n...\n    // Function to dismiss and remove the dialog from the manager\n    function closeDlg(dlg) {\n        // If the dialog is defined\n        if (angular.isDefined(dlg)) {\n            // Fetch the index from the dialogues\n            var index = dlgs.indexOf(dlg);\n\n            // Remove the dialogues\n            dlgs.splice(index, 1);\n\n            // Dismiss the dialogue\n            dlg.dismiss();\n        }\n    }\n    ...\n    return dialog_manager;\n});\n\nWhat I\'m not sure about is how I \'get hold\' of this service from within Protractor. The service is obviously not an HTML element, so I can\'t do something like dialogService = element(by.id(...));... \nHow would I get hold of the service in order to use its functions within my test script?\nEdit\nThe HTML for the dialog appears to have been written so that it can be used for a number of different dialogs, and not just for this form:\n<div class="modal-header dialog-header-confirm">\n    ...\n</div>\n<div ng-form="chartConfigForm" class="ui-tab-container ui-tab-vertical">\n    ...\n</div>\n<div class="modal-footer">\n    ...\n    <button class="btn btn-default"\n            type="button"\n            ng-click="cancel()">\n        <span data-i18n="Cancel" class="hidden-xs"></span>\n        <span class="ti-na hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg"></span>\n    </button>\n    <button class="btn btn-default"\n            type="button"\n            ng-disabled="tabIdx.type === \'tabs\' && tabIdx.idx === 0"\n            ng-click="back()">\n        <span data-i18n="Back" class="hidden-xs"></span>\n        <span class="ti-angle-left hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg"></span>\n    </button>\n    <button class="btn btn-default"\n            type="button"\n            ng-disabled="isLastTab()"\n            ng-click="next()">\n        <span data-i18n="Next" class="hidden-xs"></span>\n        <span class="ti-angle-right hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg"></span>\n    </button>\n    <button class="btn btn-brand"\n            type="submit"\n            ng-click="draw()">\n        <span data-i18n="Draw" class="hidden-xs"></span>\n        <span class="ti-bar-chart hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg"></span>\n    </button>\n</div>\n\nI\'m looking for recommendations on test automation framework for running a suite of command line applications.  \nI\'m used to more development unit testing type of frameworks such as xUnit or MSTest based tools. \nI\'m looking for something targeted more towards a compiled executable types, rather than require access to the programs and classes. \nI would like something that has a common setup/tear-down mechanism (depending on the application, we may need need to construct a queue with the queue manager) and will have common reporting feature to other tools such as Jenkins.  \nWe\'ve used cTest but I find that a bit lacking for the setup.  I\'ve started looking at shUnit2 but I\'m curious what else may be available.  \nThe target is Linux system.\nI\'m very much interested in taking ISTQB Software Testing Foundation course.\nBut before I start with the course I wish to familiarize myself with Software Quality Assurance & Testing. \nSo are there any online sites that might help me with the syllabus also with mock exams?\nPlease send links !!!\nIn the ISTQB syllabi I found this statement:\n\n"Note that test automation refines the fundamental test process by\n  inserting test generation between test design and test\n  implementation."\n\nCan anyone clarify the role of test generation step?\nSince we say that IDs are faster and are preferred over XPaths, how different would the execution of the following be?\n\ndriver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[@id=\'Save\']")).click();\ndriver.findElement(By.id("Save")).click();\n\nI need to write automated tests for jQuery based plugins using Selenium WebDriver and Mocha. I have 3 questions.\n1.mocha test command is used to start the test. If I need to do the tests parallelly in all the browsers, how would I achieve it? By looping through the test suites using different browser plugins or is there a better way to achieve this?\n2. My Test cases mostly involve checking with the attributes and content of the DOMElement. Can\'t I use selenium web driver just to open the browser and deal every other with plain javascript instead of using Selenium API to get the element, and do some actions on the button like performing Click Operation? Mocha allows this when it is run in the browser.\n3. In which case, should I use build tools like Grunt or Gulp for my test cases? Kindly explain this with an example.  \nI\'m currently working on a website which takes 2-3 MINS to complete the page load. Even after all the elements are visible,still browser keeps loading. I have figured it out that happens because the website contains social media links such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram etc. Facebook access is prohibited in where I am right now. SO browser took so long to complete the connection between those buttons and social media servers. I blocked Facebook from host file even but no luck yet. Is there a way to stop running scripts or stop making connections with those servers from those buttons.? \nPS: I\'m not the developer of the website. So cannot change anything on the code. I checked with chrome,Firefox and even with IE drivers. - no luck.\nSo im in a bit of a conundrum. I have a Rails project which i\'ve written Automated tests for in Capybara using ChromeDriver/Selenium. It works great, but is quite long.\nI also have headless chrome driver "set up" for this project....but honestly it just doesn\'t work great. Headless chrome driver is a bit early and has gone through a lot of changes but will probably inevitably be the "go-to" headless driver of choice probably taking over PhantomJS.\nThis being said, i\'d typically use poltergeist to run headless because it works well...but at the same time phantomjs will probably eventually lose out to headless chrome, and not to mention a lot of the issues we\'ve seen with this particular app have been browser related.\nSo that being said: Is it crazy to run a browser based UI Automation on a CI Server? Obviously it will be slower but def. more accurate. Is this common practice? I\'ve only been doing automation for a little over a year but not a whole lot via CI.\nThanks!\nI am generating an extent report every time my regression suite runs. The project folder structure is ProjectFolder/Results. I am running the regression suite from Jenkins job. So whenever the regression suite is executed, a folder is created under the Results folder with the name Regression_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. The YYYYMMDDHHMMSS is the current time-stamp. Then the extent report is saved here. I want to set HTML Publisher as Post Build action. In this how do I set the path of the folder (Results/Regression_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) as the path is dynamic\nPlease suggest the steps.\nI am working on PhantomJS with Java for one of my project. I am looking for some help in working with PhantomJS in following scenario.\nScenario:\nStep-1: Mouse hover on tab/link then 2 sub-links will display\nStep-2: Click on 2nd sub-link (This element is not visible if width is less than 992)\nHere in Step-2, I am failing due to page is not displaying the element. I have tried following ways to resolve:\n\nAdded wait statement before clicking (Explicit wait -> wait until element clickable)\n\n\nNote: Script getting failed in this step due to element is not clickable.\n\n\nSet the custom window size (1920 X 1080)\n\n\nNote: Here my query is when I used driver.window.maximize(), I am getting window size as "1366 X 768". So I am not sure whether it will work if I set the window size as "1920 X 1080".\n\nPlease share your experiences or idea\'s to resolve this issue. Your help/suggestions are very helpful to me\n\nNOTE: I am facing this issue only PhanjomJS browser only in remaining all browsers are working fine\n\nIt seems that model based testing approach is dead. Most of tools for model based test end in 2010-2012. For example NModel is dead, Spec Expoler ends in 2012 visual studio. Why? What new methods are currently developing for testing?\nI was asked in an interview this question\nThat two different scenario requires data from a common sheet. How to we identify that data already used , while passing it as input. \nIn general how to identify the data is already used and we need to select another record from data sheet.\nMy Problem:\nI am in a situation where there is no immediate demand to test any feature (no new features in need of testing, or no new changes made)\nThis makes it difficult to identify areas that are potentially highly buggy, but there are no clear signs of that (such as recent constant crashing, customers sending tickets, or failing tests).\nMy question:\nHow do I prioritize areas of the product under test for adding tests (KPI, rules of thumb, general regression sweeps) in the absence of new feature development? Or am I overthinking it, and maybe other tasks (such as automation/process improvement) should be higher priority?\nI often get requests from developers and others to test some scenarios to check if a web app functions correctly. Generally, these scenarios don\'t have enough details and I have to waste a lot of time in getting information that should have already been given to me. So, I was thinking of forcing the entire organization to communicate such scenarios in Gherkin format, as shown below.\nGIVEN the conditions condition-1, condition-2, condition-3 etc.,\nWHEN these actions action-1, action-2, action-3 etc. are performed,\nTHEN these events occur event-1, event-2, event-3 etc.\n\nThis format seems very helpful in that it will make scenarios clear and reduce the need for unnecessary communication to find out the GIVEN, WHENS and THENS that one needs to know before they test something.\nBut, since I have limited experience in using Gherkin, I am not sure if Gherkin is the best way to communicate scenarios in all kinds of situations. I don\'t know if there are any better methods out there. So, what is the best way to write testing scenarios ?\nI\'ve seen several mentions of an issue when running tests in Firefox: the Flash player doesn\'t load the SWF if the browser window doesn\'t have focus. This causes sporadic test failures if the system used for running tests is doing anything else. I\'ve verified that if the Firefox browser is behind IE the test will hang until it times out or else I bring Firefox to the foreground manually.\nA workaround that allows the Selenium2/WebDriver test to bring the browser to the front or to override this behavior of the player would be much appreciated. \nIn my experience, Business Analysts (BA\'s) are commonly used to perform "happy path" testing when an application is developed.\nShould the reverse also be true with testers being (more) involved and performing static testing of requirements before they are handed to developers instead ?\nSome background.  I am a long time WatiN coder, and have been since I first looked at Selenium a few versions ago, and decided that it didn\'t meet my needs, and then went with WatiN.\nI now want to switch to selenium 2 (selenium web-driver).\nWhat are the best resources? Where can I can find out about getting started with Selenium 2?\nI am personally interested in the C# API, how control mapping works, and implementation examples. Selenium HQ.org still talks primarily about Selenium IDE and the older versions.\nI can see why the community can sort of look down on the ISEB exams (at least the Foundation - I haven\'t looked at the material for any of the others). So I got to wondering exactly what similar courses are out there that could genuinely help you become a better tester? I\'ve heard of the Weekend Sessions but don\'t think im quite ready for that level yet.\nI haven\'t experienced a transition from waterfall to Agile myself - I worked for companies using Prince2, waterfall approaches to managing projects, and then I got a job working for a company using Agile. But for most traditional testers, their first exposure to Agile will be when their company decides to adopt it.\nWhat resources are there for testers in a company transitioning to using an Agile approach? What problems do they tend to face, and how do they overcome those problems?\nCan anyone recommend any good security testing resources?  Although I have a basic security skillset, I\'d like to improve this.  Some of the training I\'ve seen online however seems kind of sketchy.  Resources would have to be a reasonable price.\n\nI know that there\'s no one answer for this, but still, hoping for some recommendations.\n\nI was wondering if there are any repositories or wikis of formal testing techniques - test design ideas, like pairwise or boundary. I couldn\'t find one so far. \nThanks!\nAhmet\nI have a test matrix for my product\'s installation, which is n-dimensional, where n is about 11 or 12 at this point. For instance, the OS is one dimension, and the DB is another, and the Reporting engine is a third etc.\nIn this matrix, every intersection of these parameters is a separate test that needs to be run and reported. \nHow can I display these results so that they can be easily reviewed to see which tests have been run/passed/failed?\nOne of the things that I miss about WatiN is the ability to attach to browser instances that were not spawned by Selenium.  In my last position, this was the whole reason why I used WatiN, as the browser was always spawned by another application.\nI was hoping that I would be able to do this through .getWindowHandle() and then .SwitchTo().Window(string), but this doesn\'t seem as though it\'s the case.\n\nThe ability to do this is invaluable when it comes to writing and debuging scripts and do hope that I\'m either doing something wrong, or that it\'s on the roadmap.\n\nLet\'s say you have product or project that is coming near to a next release and that has previous versions released a while ago and that has a big suite of automated user acceptance tests that just take too long to run, from one day to two. \nHow often do you run these?\nHow do you handle bugs (failing tests) in such a large suite of tests?\nHow to maintain automation framework for  different browsers like IE and FF?\nIn my current set up, I maintain two different configuration properties files, one with xpath locators that FF supports and one with DOM values mostly for IE.\nWhat I tried to do is switch between the Properties files so as to support the respective browsers when running , Is there a better way?\nI\'m looking for a good Mockito tutorial. I found some things, but either they are incomplete (which means: if you need something a bit more complicated than the basics, forget it), or they are badly explained.\nDo you know some tutorials well written and covering at least all the major topics of the library?\nHas anybody worked on testing Cassandra DB which is a NOSQL distributed DB?\nWhat are the important things to be taken into account while doing this?\nI have heard as well as followed concept of keeping UI objects in external filed (xml or properties files in java). But there are times when I need to keep the objects with in test because I use them dynamically.\nFor example consider one html table with div having uniquq id. The div could have n number of links. I need to read their innertext. So I would be doing -\nfor(int i=0; i<=CSSCount(div[id=\'unique\']>a);i++) {\n    print(selenium.getText(css=div[id=\'unique\']>a:nth-child(i)))\n\n}\nSo I have app object available in test class it self, that is - css=div[id=\'unique\']>li:nth-child(i) as I need to iterate through its elements. Is it possible to externalize such app objects also?\nI have seen some SQA groups use defect arrival or "discovery" rates in order to determine whether a piece of software is ready to be released.  The idea is that the rate at which defects are uncovered will slow to an acceptable level.\nWhat are these techniques?  How is an "acceptable" defect arrival rate determined?\nEdit: Daniel\'s answer gives a nice list of items.  To elaborate on the question: what are the methodologies that allow setting of appropriate rates of decline / discovery of defects?\nEdit 2: This link shows an example of the methodology.  Has anyone used this or something like it?\n\nI\'ve tried my best to keep this question non-subjective so am not asking which blogs are definitively "the BEST" but instead am using the opportunity to just try to broaden my scope of reading around the subject.\n\nI am already reading blogs by Michael Bolton, James Bach, Alan Richardson, Dorothy Graham, the Google Testing blog (James Whittaker) and the Weekend Testing blog. \n\nCan anyone make some further recommendations?\n\nI have a Junior QA interview coming up, and I was asked to learn the basics of Selenium. I have done this through free tutorials. I am fine with the Selenium concepts, but I was told I would be asked how I would test real-world objects at a conceptual level. I may be asked to test any random object in the world but it will probably be a simple one - bicycle, can opener, etc. I will not have to write code but explain it orally. I am not sure how to approach studying for this and how I should relate it to Selenium testing with Java. I can\'t find any resources that are similar to this, so I am asking here to be pointed in the right direction, or for a conceptual example for a real-world object.\nThe person in HR didn\'t really give me much info other than that I would be asked to explain how I would test real world objects without writing any code.\nFor example, let\'s say I\'m asked how I would test a bicycle. The way I would answer this now not knowing what they\'re really looking for is this:\nI would ask what the function of the bicycle is and how the various parts work together to achieve this functionality. I would deduce that the bicycle has 3 primary functions; be driven by a drive train through the rotation of the peddles by the user, and a braking mechanism operated by the user, and the swivel of the front wheel to turn.\nNow that I have determined the primary functionality I would break these down into smaller problems to test. For the sake of this post, I will just go into the drive train. I would determine when the user pedals it will turn the chaining which it would pull the chain forward. This chain is connected to a chaining on the rear wheel which turns the wheel through the transfer of energy given from the chain. I would then ask is this the only way the user can use the bicycle? Is pedaling the only function that the client has access to? If, so I would test to make sure this function properly catches any invalid input or uses.\nI would need to test each individual piece so as to build a larger test. I  would check to see how the Pedal class calls the Chaining class. How do they interact? What would happen if I passed the argument "pedal_backwards" to the chaining? What kind of constraints with pedaling does the Chaining enforce? Next, I would check to see how the Chaining calls the Chain class. What constraints are there in this invocation? I would do the same for the rear chaining.\nBasically I would break the object down into smaller problems and test how they interact with each other. This way changes to the code base will still be testable with my tests and will continue to work autonomously.\nAm I on the right track? I wasn\'t really given much information just that an engineer would pick a real-world object and ask me to test it.\nThanks\nOnce i reset the password through selenium script the confirmation overlay page just remains for 2 sec which i`s not captured by selenium to inspect.

Headless browser testing is not an area I\'m familiar with but I\'m looking to leverage it\'s capabilities as I\'m looking at quickly creating some orders on a test website, but I\'m not actually concerned with how the UI looks and behaves; I just want to ensure the order lands in the db correctly.\nAs a result of the above I have a couple of questions:\n1) When writing a framework in c# are there any recommended tools for this that I can look into?\n2) Are there any good tutorials/code examples out there that I can utilise?\nSo I\'m using selenium with cucumber and right now and run my tests sequentially, at the end of the execution I collect the log and the prints. \nMy question is, once I start executing them in parallel, how do I separate the execution logs?\nI know that I can copy the prints to a specific folder that follows the scenario name and that works great, but I was wishing I could separate the logs during the execution too, so I could use them as evidence, it often can hold valuable information.\nWhat is the best practice on collecting evidence during parallel execution?\nI\'ve looked for it in the Internet but no luck.\nThanks in advance!\nI am tasked with testing an IOS application...I have an iPad & and iPhone to test on but am looking for an application that will let me test on my windows machine, possibly using an emulator. \nAny ideas?\nI am Using Cucumber Selenium Framework for Test Execution. \nAnd I have set system Properties correctly because the same script was running fine but now it is throwing "The path to the driver executable must be set by the webdriver.chrome.driver system property;" exception\nHere is my Code:\n\n\nWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\nJavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\n\n\n\n@Given("^I am at Kogan Consumer Portal Login page$")\npublic void i_am_at_Kogan_Consumer_Portal_Login_page() throws Throwable {\n\n    System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", \n    "C:\\\\Users\\\\Shreya\\\\Desktop\\\\CucumberFramework\\\\CucumberFramework\\\\src\\\\test\\\\java\\\\CucumberFramework\\\\resources\\\\chromedriver.exe");\n    driver.manage().window().maximize();\n    driver.get("http://testing-palm-frontend.solvup.com");\n    if (driver.findElements(By.xpath("//input[@formcontrolname=\'caseNumber\']")).size() != 0 && driver.findElements\n            (By.xpath("//input[@formcontrolname=\'taxInvoiceNumber\']")).size()!= 0) {\n\n        System.out.println("Successfully Redirected to Kogan Consumer Portal Login Page");\n\n    }\n    else {\n\n        Assert.fail("Failed to Redirect to Kogan Consumer Portal Login Page");\n    }\n\n}}\n\nWhat am i doing wrong?\nI am using Katalon Studio for test automation. The reports are written to the disc. But, after a while, after many test suites are executed, the reports folder has grown to more than 40 GB. I would like to free up disc space by deleting reports that are, say, older than one or two months.\nIs there a downside to this approach? If reports are not reviewed after a month, they are probably not that important, right?\nEDIT:\nI know the importance of reports varies between different organizations and clients. As far as my organization is concerned, my hands are pretty much free. However, I wouldn\'t like to do something rash now that I might regret in the future.

When running on Firefox, there is a noticeable lagging and the shapes are more jerky / choppy.\n\nBefore asking the actual question, let me describe the current situation.\nThe IT department consists of a few Scrum-like teams, with one or two software testers per team.\nFurthermore there are two overarching roles not bound to a team: the QA team lead, and a test automation expert.\nThe test automation expert has achieved the following in about 18 months:\n\nCreate a framework to write API tests\nCreate a framework to write UI tests\nCreate a framework to set up data (using SQL and events) for automated tests\nCreate a tool to collect and store results from all test runs\nOver 2500 API tests have been written (including by the other testers)\nOver 120 UI tests have been written\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nTraining of the team members is ongoing (basic coding skills to writing automated tests).\nTests are integrated in CI pipelines by the team lead and architectural team.\nMaintenance of API tests is a responsibility being pushed to the teams.\n\nConsidering the above, the current \'test automation\' work is now limited to:\n\nmaintenance of frameworks and tests (but that\'s decreasing)\ntraining/coaching (limited in time of course)\nwriting additional API/UI tests on new features for the teams\n\nThe question\nIs there a next level of challenges for this role - beyond the frameworks? And beyond simply adding more tests? In what other ways can the role support the QA process?\nOne idea was exploring AI test automation but that is quite a different beast. Especially because the ROI - for in-house tools - seems hard to defend.\nAdditional edit\n\nThe tests are run in pipelines (each team has at least one pipeline, and there are pipelines for consolidated Dev/Release branches). Especially for releases, tests provide a quick feedback and are fairly consistently at about 98,5% passing rate.\nTest data management: currently, some pipelines deploy to both a "manual testing environment" having a full restored database, and and "automated testing environment" having an empty database. This database is first of all prefilled with fixed core data (specific scripts). Furthermore every test is self-sufficient in that it prepares its own customers, contracts etc.\n\nHere is my HTML code,\n    <div class="input-group-btn search-panel dropdown open">\n    <input type="search" id="footerSearch" class="form-control search-input search-filter-component" name="x" placeholder="Search term...">\n    <span class="input-group-btn gosearch-btn">\n            <button class="btn  search-filter-component" type="button"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search"></span></button>\n        </span>\n\nI am getting below error, Exception in thread "main"\n    org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException:\n    Element info: {Using=xpath, value=//span[@class=\'input-group-btn gosearch-btn\']}\n        at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(Unknown Source)\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(Unknown Source)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Unknown Source)\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.ErrorHandler.createThrowable(ErrorHandler.java:216)\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.ErrorHandler.throwIfResponseFailed(ErrorHandler.java:168)\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver.execute(RemoteWebDriver.java:635)\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver.findElement(RemoteWebDriver.java:368)\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver.findElementByXPath(RemoteWebDriver.java:473)\n        at org.openqa.selenium.By$ByXPath.findElement(By.java:361)\n        at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver.findElement(RemoteWebDriver.java:360)\n        at PncSite.EnterSite.main(EnterSite.java:35)\n\nThanks for your update.

I was wondering when debugging, is there a way to save the state of the system up to a certain step in the feature file, if they all pass. For example, take this exaggerated example below\n   Given I am a New User\n   And There is an Event on a certain date\n   When I log in\n   And Go to the Events page\n   And I select the Event\n   And I go to the Payments Page\n   And I attempt to pay with credit card\n   (cont)\n\nIn the example above, if I am checking why credit card payments were failing in the test, I\'d have to rerun the test loads of times to get the system into the state I wanted it in (user, event created). Is there a way to save the state of the system once a step passes? So, therefore, running the test above and it failing on the last step, means that if I run it again it will restore the state of the system based on a snapshot of how it was after the last step and continue to run from the next step. Example...\n   Given I am a New User\n   (snapshot of the system with a new user is recorded)\n   And There is an Event on a certain date\n   (snapshot of the system with a new user and event is recorded)\n   When I log in\n   (snapshot of the system with a new user and event is recorded and the user is logged in)\n\nI worked in a place that used an in-house test runner and they were able to do it, just wondering if this is a feature that is available?\nI\'m trying my hands at intern.js to automate my UI test.

We are writing functional tests (dozens, in future few hundred of kbytes of high level language code) and don\'t actually mess with original software code -- we test the executable. The question is about managing the tests on at leasts two branches.\nThe software consists of several components. Some of them are parallel and their updates influe only 5% of our tests code. Some are perpendicular and touch everything. The perpendicular component change is solvable via versioning the abstract communication layers.  \nMy idea is:\n\nhave a universal wrapper, which recognizes the version of software and:\n\nin case of component\'s big change the wrapper runs another tests file\nin case of tests set change the skipIf Version >/</==/... decorators work for us\n\nremove outdated tests time to time according to Skip details\nhave a single branch (trunk) in a repository\n\nBut my collegue says:\n\nbranch the tests\ntime to time put one branch over another, throwing away the Stable one\n"we don\'t need ifs - they make code too complex"\n\nSo while we are developing several (at least Dev and Beta) branches at the same time, we would mess with folders and do copypaste. And what\'s wrong with if? I thought they are ok in programming...\n\nP.S.: wanted tags: branching, code-organization, versioning, functional-testing\nCurrently, after every action that adds or changes data, we verify that that data was successfully added/changed in the database by querying the tables directly. I feel this is  redundant because that data is already being pulled by the application and is displayed correctly (or incorrectly) in the application. Wouldn\'t any data inconsistencies expose themselves in the application itself?\nThis is the jist of the issue, but I will provide a simplified test case to expand on what I\'m talking about:\n\n\nGo to user "John Smith" profile and update his phone number from "(999) 999-9999" to "(666) 666-6666" and click the save button in the application\nVerify application displays "Successfully changed user profile"\nGo to preview profile and verify John Smith\'s profile reflects the changes\nVerify table USER_PROFILE in DBusers database updated with changes\n\n\nIs it necessary to check the table in the database if we\'ve already verified the application is displaying the data correctly? The application is ALREADY pulling the data from the database table, so obviously if the application is displaying the data correctly then the data in the database is correct. Am I missing something?\nThanks for your input.\nMore info: To me, it seems that the only practical purpose for verifying a database directly (for our circumstances) would be to verify that any data replication is successful. We have web and console based apps that use separate DBMSs. The two we use are SQL Server and DB2. After specific data is added to SQL Server, a job runs that replicates it to DB2. They have different structures, so the tables / fields are all different between the two. I can understand verifying this replication has performed successfully.\nThe Selenium IDE browser extension is great for quick and easy automated tests.

These processes are typically getting the right software, installation on our systems, installation testing and verification, validation, how to handle updates from the supplier (bug fixes vs upgrades in functionality and whether or not to upgrade), retirement, ...\nCan someone point me to relevant ISO/IEEE/... standards or guidelines where such processes are described? I have been looking at some IEEE standards (1074-2006, 1058-1998, 730-2002,...) but the focus there always lies on software that the organisation itself develops. I need some internationally recognized standard from which I can derive a kind of software configuration plan (I hope that\'s the right terminology) for our software in which the general processes I mentioned are specialized for our organisation. \nThanks.\nI have recently gone through a Test Automation pattern i.e., BeyondPageObjectpattern in Selenium.

Let\'s say we have a system that qualifies whether an employee deserves for promotion or not and want to test it.\nThe system recognizes such candidates for promotion by counting how many hours in a row a user did overtime, how many commitments it completed. It does not operates on statistics, but do calculate them themselves based on the work registered by the user.\nI could set data for test in a very precise way:\ncreateUser()\n  .with(overtime().on(DayOfWeek.FRIDAY).from(16).to(20))\n  .with(overtime().on(DayOfWeek.SATURDAY).from(10).to(15))\n  .with(overtime().on(DayOfWeek.SUNDAY).from(14).to(19))\n  .with(commitment().plannedFor(days(5)).completedIn(days(1))\n  .with(commitment().plannedFor(days(1)).completedIn(days(3));\n\nBut I could also define a specification for the test data that is more concise \ncreateUser()\n .with(overtime().of(hours(13).including(weekends()))\n .with(commitments().completedBeforeDeadline(0.5))\n\nand is used by the test framework to generate actual data for the tests.\nHaving this kind of abstraction in the test (only a few most important variables), I am immediately able to grasp the idea of test. Also, I can write much more combinations of test in a short time.\nI know we haven\'t invented a wheel, so I would like to read more about this approach, its risks etc but don\'t know how to search for it.

There is a link against the Epics for adding directly to an Epic.\nThere\'s someone who oversees QA - let\'s call him Joe. During 2 years of development we haven\'t had real load tests. Now release is getting close and QA is responsible for preparing and executing load tests. We (dev team) have suggested, that the load tests should be prepared and executed ASAP, before UAT starts and re-executed at least once before release. \nOur proposal has been refused by Joe. The reason was that code is still changing and every code change could possibly break test scripts and require them to be updated. Joe explained that load tests should happen after code freeze, preferably after everything is already approved by the business. It was also refused by head of QA for the same reasons.\nI\'m not really into testing, so - is this really the way to go? Is it common practice to load test just before the release? Or are they all insane?\nWe have an application coming up, which is a hybrid application developed using Phonegap.

Did cURL help you isolate any defect or understand the problem better than HTTP Request?

How do you QA otherwise? \nAny pointers on what people in the field are doing would be great.\nRemark/Edit 2011-11-27:\nAt this stage the question is sort of open ended (could be a community wiki like on stackoverflow). I presented a 4 hour workshop about testing at AnDevCon 2 and found out about some new development and available tools as well. \nI\'ve been looking at calculating the ROI on automated test on a project that I\'ve been working on. However, I\'m a little stuck when it comes to determining a good method for this. Simply counting the defects found when executed on the continuous integration sever doesn\'t really help as many developers run the test locally before checking in code, so I can accurately count how many defect have been found. So my question is how would I calculate this? My gut feeling is that they have massively helped, but I need to quantify this!\nI\'ve worked in a variety of environments with differing ratios of QA / SDET personnel vs. developers focused on building and maintaining application features.\n\nIs there such a thing as a "right" ratio?  My suspicion is that things vary a lot, but what factors should be considered for the number of staff?\n\nSo I use xpath locators and slowly converting to CSS.\nI haven\'t found a way to do an exact match based on text.\nFor example converting //a[text()=\'Log Out\'].\nI know you can do css=a:contains(\'Log Out\') but I want to match exactly to the text. Also I know I can do link=Log Out but looking for a solution with CSS.  \nI understand and practice most normal testing methodologies, however for systems with several distinct interacting processes testing obviously becomes a lot harder. Unit testing is often not possible, or preventively difficult. \nI am interested in the tools, techniques, and idea\'s for automated testing of large distributed systems.\n\nI have found the following video presentation from a google engineer about some of their testing techniques. Do know of any other similar presentations?\nWhat comes to mind is Make, or build.xml, but I have not found a comprehensive Orchestration tool for python testing yet.\nAny suggestions?\nSo right now to run my Selenium 1 tests I use a custom Firefox Profile that sets when I launch my Selenium Server.\nIs there a way to properly set this profile to run in Selenium 2? I\'ve tried setting the FF profile using new FirefoxProfile("path"); however that doesnt seem to work. What it DOES to is delete everything in that path folder(weird, I know). Can I use the Selenium Server to tell Selenium 2 what to use? Or does this just not work in Selenium 2b3 yet? \nAs I understand it, this sentence means that automated tests don\'t find new bugs in existing code (though they might catch a new bug in new code that breaks old code).  Is this correct?  Or is this piece of wisdom actually claiming that regression tests rarely catch regressions in practice?\nAlso, is this statement wrong for automated exploratory testing (e.g., fuzzing, randomized inputs to data-driven tests) that can end up running specific tests that were never run before and finding unexpected exceptions, hangs, or program crashes that indicate bugs?  Would it be more accurate to say that automated checking will not find new bugs in old code?  Or am I still missing the point of this statement?\n\nThis seems like a commonly cited piece of tester wisdom, so I really feel like I need to understand both what the statement is getting at, and any exceptions to its correctness.\n\nI\'m trying to find a way to test the interactions of our platform with external servers, like Twitter, for example.\nOn our online photo sharing application, we have, for example features which let the user publish a content on his/her Twitter feed. The code relies on Twitter4J.\nHow can we write an automated test to check if a tweet was really sent to the feed, publishing photos on Facebook etc.\nThe difficulty is: I can hardly modify the API in order to make my specific test, and of course, I have no influence on the external system.\nI am developing a asp.net mvc site that depends deeply on a 3rd party web service.\nI would like to know what is the best approach to develop this site since the web service is not ready yet and I can\'t wait it to be ready to start developing.\nI am using Specflow and selenium to drive my development.\nI\'m quite interested in the Scipy/Numpy project which is basically a Python scientific computation/numerical methods library. I\'m also interested in testing. What are some good approaches for testing such a library, or any software library? There already are extensive unit tests, which run pretty well. But what would an acceptance test look like? Thoughts? \nI\'ve worked for companies that have little documentation for their applications, and most of it is probably comments in code. \nHow is a person, who is placed in the quality assurance department, suppose to verify that an application is doing what was intended to do; if there are no requirements documents and they are just told to "play around" or "read the user manual"?\nIn a similar vein to the question blogs to follow to further learning, I would like to ask if there are any noteworthy testing podcasts? Searching in iTunes domes up pretty empty on the topic.\nI know there are heaps of development ones, are there any good testing podcasts?\nNote: This would be community wiki, but the feature on questions appears to have been removed.\nSince it is not possible to acquire all s/w and h/w under the sun, we often resort to using virtual machine, user agent, multiple IE etc.\nI have had instance when I did not find an application functioning on a virtual machine especially multiple IE but when approached another colleague having the desired configuration, it worked well.\nGiven such instance I began to doubt using such simulation for testing. Do you also test using such simulation than actual device. Do you trust in testing using such simulation than using actual device?\nWhy (& how) do Static and Dynamic testing complement each other?\nI have a problems while picking up variables set by the Regular Expression Extractor in a Beanshell.\n\n\nThe result of Regular Expression Extractor:\nJMeterVariables:\nJMeterThread.last_sample_ok=true\nJMeterThread.pack=org.apache.jmeter.threads.SamplePackage@120cc173\nSTART.HMS=090316\nSTART.MS=1507255396987\nSTART.YMD=20171006\nTESTSTART.MS=1507266934916\nreturnLink=not found\nreturnLink_1=/tripper/payment/info?booking=KD6YGS4L8I\nreturnLink_1_g=1\nreturnLink_1_g0="returnLink":"/tripper/payment/info?booking=KD6YGS4L8I"\nreturnLink_1_g1=/tripper/payment/info?booking=KD6YGS4L8I\nreturnLink_matchNr=1\n\nNow I want to using returnLink_1 in Beanshell, but I cannot get And print it out.

For instance, suppose a program has the requirement: Values between 1 and 100 are true, while all other values are false.\nfunc calc(x):\n  if (x >= 1 and x <= 100):\n    return True\n  else:\n    return False\nA lot of books (Pressman, for instance) say you have to use the inputs 0, 1, 2, 99, 100 and 101 to test such a program.\nSo, my question is: Why use the inputs \'2\' and \'99\'? I tried to make a program with a fault such that the test case set (0, 1, 2, 99, 100 and 101) exposes a failure and the test case set (0, 1, 100, 101) does not expose it, but I can\'t make such program.\nCould you make such program? If not, it is a waste of resources to create redundant test cases \'2\' and \'99\'.\nI have been using Selenium/Java/Maven for functional automation testing in my project. But since angular is getting a lot of popularity, the development team has started using it for the development of new web applications in the project.

I have been going to through most of the topics in the forum on POS testing and i was able to find inputs on scenarios for cashier activity,credit card and performance.\nExperts please throw some light in this area for me to set up a POS testing base.\nThanks for all your help.\nI have a Web Performance test created in VSTS Ultimate 2013 with Record feature of the tool. This test involves the below mentioned scenario:-\n\nLogin to application\nNavigate to the Search Page\nOpen Create New Page\nEnter Data and Save record (at this point an entry is created in Database too)\n\nI have added Validation Rule (Finding Username, which is displayed on page header once record save operation is completes) in this test, just to make sure that record is saved and web test is working fine, all the test data (like Name, Address etc.) is coming from CSV file. Now, when I run this test it executes well and assertion (Find Username) works fine. Entry is there in Database too.\nNow, I have created a load test in VSTS Ultimate which is using this web test and specified the user load as 5 with constant load pattern and Iteration count as 1, this test case still creates only 1 entry in Database while I have 5 rows with different dataset in CSV file. But if I increase the number of Iterations from 1 to 5, then it creates 5 records; which is a bit confusing. Why VSTS Ultimate is not creating 5 records with constant load as 5, why it is creating only 1 record for 5 user load.\nFirst I thought that application might not be able to handle 2 concurrent user load but if that had been the case then I should get Assertion Failed error or some other error which is not there.\nWhat could be the possible reason for this behavior of load pattern? Do I need to change anything or I\'m missing something in my tests? \nI am QA automation engineer. We have so many clients for whom we are doing web scraping.

I found sources saying that black box techniques are techniques in which you input something in a program and check if the output matches with the wanted result, if it doesn\'t, there\'s an error somewhere.\nThe source mentioned above says there are techniques, of which the cause-effect or root-effect, the equivalent partitioning and the boundary value analysis are three.\nHow can a software tester without any knowledge of the program do these tests? To partition it right, I guess you should have knowledge about the program, which especially seems to be the case in the cause-effect technique. Am I misunderstanding some definitions?

When I click on a particular button "Ophalen", a web service request is made and the responses are parsed and displayed on the UI. \nWhen I attempt to do the same thing using chromedriver and selenium 2.53, I can see that the button is clicked but the responses are not displayed on the UI. Consequently my test is failing when I use chrome browser to run my test.\nThe same test is running perfectly fine on firefox browser.\nCan I safely conclude that my application is not compatible with chrome, but I cannot justify this because, I am able to get the web service response when I perform the action manually.\nPlease post your opinions.\nThanks!\nIf I have a test case that passes on one version of the code and a change is made to some lines in the code that are not hit by this test case, is there a possibility that the test case fails after this change? If yes, can you provide an example?\nTo clarify more: If I have for example a code block as follows\n    Statement1;\n    Statement2;\n    Statement3;\n\nAnd I have a test case that only hits Statements 1 and 2. Now suppose a change is made to statement 3 and I need to run the regression to make sure nothing is broken. In that case, does it make sense to run the test case that does not hit Statement 3. Is there any possibility that the test case breaks after the modification?\nI\'m looking to test an account-creation feature of my product. The back-end of my application (which I do not control, so I can\'t intercept the sending of the email) sends an email to the address of my choice. I will need to then retrieve that email so that I can "click" on the activation link to complete the account creation. I\'m using wdio and my tests are written in JavaScript, so JavaScript/node packages would be most convenient/appropriate.  Any suggestions of services/packages to help with that?  \nBasically, I\'m imagining this flow: In the account sign-up flow, I specify  an email address of testaddress+unique@someservice.org.  I then query the someservice.org until I get the account activation email that was addressed to testaddress+unique, retrieve the email, and parse it to extract the activation link.\nI am unable to click login form element below site:\n\nhttp://www.w-trading.co.kr/member/login.php?\n\nI try:\ndriver.FindElement(By.XPath("//*[@id=\'memberId\']")).SendKeys("my_id");\n\nand\ndriver.FindElement(By.Id("memberId")).SendKeys("my_id");\n\nbut each code occur error.\nHow can I solve this problem? Thanks for your watching.\nI\'m using Selenium in C#.\nWe have several Angular applications (Micro UIs) and they are all 100% covered by our UATs (User Acceptance Tests) written with Protractor (Angular Test Framework based on Selenium).\nThere are several problems with this approach, although this is probably the best and suggested way for Angular Testing:\n\nTime consuming... Do not understand me wrong. These tests are super handy, whenever we make a change, we let these run (these are actually integrated in our CI/CD Pipelines) and be sure that the app works still as we want. But still, even if we test a use case at least 1 time manually anyway, this has to be also written in Protractor/Jasmine. And takes time..\nThese Tests are very dependant on HTML Structure. Some locators find the html elements with xpaths (very bad), some with id etc. but at the end, any change in HTML, would somehow cause a change in our tests.. although the change does not change anything on UI for the end user.\nThe whole CSS is ignored. Like the typical Selenium Tests, all tests run against the DOM, and except tests which checks the hidden/shown fields, over 90% of our CSS is ignored.. if one day, a single line which never supposed to be shown in 2 lines shown, really is shown in 2 lines, we will not know that automatically.\n\nI imagine a test framework like this: you open your app on browser, and start the keyboard/mouse capture tool of your test framework. Then you start testing a scenario on your app in your browser, for example you move your mouse on a specific location, you click on a button, you choose a value from a dropdown, a redirect occurs, and at the end you look on your screen and see if the desired X text is shown on the right side.\nThe only thing which the capture tool cannot know is what you really checked (X text on the right side). For this you take a screenshot of this area, and put in your test framework.\nThese mouse/keyboard captures will then be replayed while testing on the Pipeline and the checks/asserts are done against these screenshots.. even with some pixel offset maybe, if you do not want your tests fail in case of tiny css changes.\nWould it be usefull at all? Do you know some frameworks like this? Specially which we may use for our Angular apps? Do you think this approch is better regarding time and quality?\nThe benefits would be:\n\nSince you just let your capturing tool run while you are manually testing your app just after you finish your implementation, and make some screenshots and put them in framework somehow, tests would not consume so much time like writing code for UATs.\nThey would mostly run independent of HTML Structure. So as long as our button is located on its location and on its behaviour, it would not bother us if it now has a one more div parent in the DOM.\nOur Css would also be tested since we compare pictures.\n\nAnd at the end, this is just what we want, to look on the app and see if it looks right, click and enter some keyboard events and check again if we see what we want. Not like protractor or selenium tests, which just blindly communicate with the DOM.\nShort description\nMy current test scenario is about designing a test staging environment that is addressed via an API gateway. We chose WSO2. They already have corresponding test frameworks on board, but I want to go other ways, because we already use acceptance testing via Cucumber and serenity. \nAnother problem is that several projects are currently being tested in regression. Of course I have to take a look at these projects to change them to the current and agile way.\nIn my planning I want to do acceptance tests, UI tests and penetration tests in the test environment (but also in the production environment).\nFor the acceptance test, we currently used serenity in the test environments and, of course, integrated reporting accordingly. \nFor penetration testing I would use ZAP or a similar tool and want to integrate it into the test environment as well as into the production environment.\nCurrent structure:\n\nVarious projects with applications that are still being tested via\nregression on the one hand.\nIsolated projects tested through serenity and pipelined into\nJenkins  \nCurrently no penetration test available\nCurrently no load or performance test available\nThe test team is currently designed for three testers\n\nPlanned structure\n\nAPI Gateway Solution via WSO2\nPlanned integration of serenity Jenkins pipelines into WSO2 as\nacceptance test on test environment\nPlanned load and performance test on the production environment\n(possibly already on the staging environment?)\nPlanned penetration test on the test environment as well as on the production environment\n\nqueries\n\nWould you rather use your own test frameworks in WSO2? Or should existing test frameworks be connected to WSO2 via Jenkins? \nShould integration testing be performed on the staging environment?\nWhat would your test plan look like on an appropriate staging\nenvironment?\nShould Load and Performance Testing only be performed on the\nproduction environment?\nShould one use the existing penetration test solutions of WSO2 or\nrather integrate own solutions?\n\nI\'m running into an issue with getting the traffic from a WCF-based Windows desktop client to show up in the JMeter recorder - and I\'m hoping someone out there might be able to point me in the right direction.  \nComplicating things a bit, I\'m not working directly with the developers of the system, but rather for one of their customers - which somewhat limits my access to some of the information and expertise I would otherwise expect to have.  The client runs over WCF with a binding to an HTTPS endpoint on Azure.\nI have JMeter running on the same box as the client.  I have the JMeter Proxy Server working and the ApacheJMeterTemporaryRootCA.crt in place and working.  The client doesn\'t have it\'s own proxy settings, but does appear to be honoring useDefaultWebProxy="true" (as indicated by the client failing with SSL security warnings when the temp cert isn\'t in place).  However, when I exercise the client with the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder running, none of the traffic to and from the client ever shows up in the recorder.  When I use a browser under the same setup, the traffic is getting recorded as expected.\nBeing able to get the recorder working is vital because I don\'t have access to enough information about the client\'s protocols to try building out tests for them manually (and I suspect it may prove outside of my skillset, given my very limited experience with WCF).\nAny useful solutions, suggestions, tips, or pointers would be GREATLY appreciated!\n(I\'m posting this question in XXXXX to maximize my chances of getting the right answer quickly.  If this type of cross-posting is frowned upon, I apologize for any inconvenience.)\nBest,\nJustin\n"If you can\'t tell me what you tested, you might as well have not tested."\nMy colleague and I have been given the task of Piloting Test Automation in our company. \nWe need help deciding on the Action Plan. \nSome Actions we noted are as below :\n\nDesign an Architecture of "Test Automation" that would include defining proper naming convention, maintaining source code, maintaining version history and control\nSelecting Stable Application for Test Automation. And also select the chunk of Test Cases based on priority for Automation.\nCreation of robust - scalable framework that includes a set of rules for writing the test scripts, so as to bring the requirement of maintenance to a minimum. Also, the scripts should be written in a way that they have the ability to cope with minor changes in the application without the need for re-writing them.\nIdentify and assign tasks to Test Automation Engineers with predefined goals and milestones. \n\nAre these points enough for us to go ahead and do the Test Automation in our company or are we missing out on any points ?  \nWe certainly all know the discussion when penetration testing makes sense. In a staging scenario, the test scenario can be interesting to use there to perform a penetration test. And, of course, also in production. \nBut yesterday we had a discussion in the team how often we want to test our projects via CI pipeline and vulnerability scanner for issues.\nThe discussion resulted in a violent exchange of blows.\n\nAs little scanning as possible. Only once a week would make sense to\nintegrate the high risk issues into the respective sprint.\nPermanent scanning via CI integration. But here the risk was described that one would find possibly too many false positives, which would go beyond any sprint planning. \nPossible drop in performance if several pages are scanned at the same time.

Here are few approaches that I can think of-\n\nVery Simple and straight approach where the testing team uses the same code repo on which dev is working, And we add the API test cases just like the unit test case in Test package of the same repo.\nPROS: less work because the testing team need not create DTOs etc., test cases will be available to the dev team, \nCONS: every time we add new test cases, we will have to do a pull request to merge the test cases, test cases will require immediate attention in case of dev code change otherwise there would be compilation failure.\nUsing a separate project with the third-party library, for example, REST ASSURED to automate the APIs testing. Here the testing team will import the dev code and use the DTOs, database access objects from the imported dev code.\nPROS: less work because the testing team need not create DTOs etc.\nCONS: test cases will require immediate attention in case of dev code change otherwise test cases will give compilation failure.\nDo not use Dev code at all and write all DTOs and everything and automate the test cases using REST Assured in a separate project.\nPROS: Not any dependency on DEV code.\nCONS: The testing team will have to create lots of DTOs for mapping the request and response JSON. This will take too much efforts and time and will be a replication of task which is already done by the dev team.\nDo not create DTOs and use JSON Schema to create DTOs at runtime and use REST ASSURED in a separate project.\nPROS: No need to create too many DTOs.Test case management and maintenance would be easy.\nCONS: Not found yet, please suggest what cons could be of this approach.\nOr Any other approach which is better than the above approaches.

And based on the first td value, fetch the second td with tag strong inside the td tag\ne.g: I have to fetch Case ID so i need to first check the first td value, if it is Case id than based on the i need to save the value inside the strong tag in a variable and use this value in the code\n<table class="table table-condensed">\n        <tbody><tr>\n            <td>Case ID: </td>\n            <td> <strong>3406872</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n                                    <tr>\n                <td>Date of Case: </td>\n                <td><strong>24-09-2018 05:54 AM</strong></td>\n            </tr>\n                                    <tr>\n                <td>Name: </td>\n                <td><strong> </strong></td>\n            </tr>\n                                                    <tr>\n                <td>Email: </td>\n                <td><strong><a href="mailto:"></a></strong></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>Phone:</td>\n                <td><strong></strong></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>Phone Mobile:</td>\n                <td><strong></strong></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>Address: </td>\n                <td>\n                    <strong><br>  </strong>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n\n                                 <tr>\n                     <td>Store Of Purchase: </td>\n                    <td><strong>JBNZ RICCARTON (029)</strong></td>\n                 </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                <td>Purchase Date: </td>\n                <td><strong>10-02-2017</strong></td>\n            </tr>\n                                                    <tr>\n                <td>Purchase Price: </td>\n                <td><strong>$463.00</strong></td>\n            </tr>\n                    <tr>\n            <td>Receipt/Tax invoice Number:</td>\n            <td><strong>0307618717 41258 029 17</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n                                            <tr>\n            <td>Floor Stock:</td>\n            <td><strong>No</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n                    <tr>\n            <td>Repaired Previously: </td>\n            <td><strong>No</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n                                <tr>\n            <td>Abuse/Misuse:</td>\n            <td><strong>No</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n                    <tr>\n            <td>Marked/Scratched: </td>\n            <td><strong>No</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Marked/Scratched Comment: </td>\n            <td><strong></strong></td>\n        </tr>\n                    <tr>\n            <td>Fault Report:</td>\n            <td><strong>Product gives electric shock to user while in use.</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n                    <tr>\n            <td>Fault Code:</td>\n            <td><strong>Other (I)</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n\n                    <tr>\n            <td>Retailer can Replicate: </td>\n            <td><strong>No</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>If not, why not: </td>\n            <td><strong></strong></td>\n        </tr>\n                    <tr>\n            <td>Within automatic replacement period:</td>\n            <td>\n                <strong>\n                    No                    </strong>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                <td> Within warranty period:</td>\n                <td><strong>No</strong></td>\n            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                <td>Within assess for repair period:</td>\n                <td><strong>No</strong></td>\n            </tr>\n                                        <tr>\n            <td>Liability of repair:</td>\n                            <td><strong>Vendor</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n\n\n                        <tr>\n               <td>Disclaimer:</td>\n               <td><strong>No</strong></td>\n            </tr>\n                                         <tr>\n        <td>Case Type:</td>\n        <td><strong>Requested in store</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n\n                                        <tr>\n            <td>Case Status:</td>\n            <td class="">\n            <strong> Closed, replaced                                </strong>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n\nThe Code that i am writing is:\nList<WebElement> allrows= driver.findElements(By.xpath("//table[@class=\'table table-condensed\']/tbody/tr"));\n    int rows = allrows.size();\n    //System.out.println(rows);\n    for(int i=0; i<rows;i++) {\n        List<WebElement> Columns= allrows.get(i).findElements(By.tagName("td"));\n\n            for(int j=0;j<2;j++) {\n\n                String CaseV = Columns.get(j).getText();\n                System.out.println(CaseV);\n\nIt is fetching me all the values like this:(This is how it comes on console)\nCase ID: \n3412943\nDate of Case:\n26-09-2018 13:27 PM\nName:\nj k\nHow can i achieve this? Can Somebody help me with this?\nLet me know if more information is needed?\nI\'m attempting to create a test framework in c# to automate some of our API tests. Relatively new to this area so have come across an issue I can\'t solve. My XML payload is as below:\n <Order>\n   <BillingAddress>\n     <AddressLine1></AddressLine1>\n     <AddressLine2></AddressLine2>\n     <City></City>\n   </BillingAddress>\n  <Items>\n    <Item IsKit="false">\n      <CountryVATRate></CountryVATRate>\n      <Group></Group>\n      <Reference></Reference>\n </Item>\n </Items>\n</Order>\n\nWhen I attempt to execute the above(using RestSharp) I get the below error:\n"System.Xml.XmlException: \'The \' \' character, hexadecimal value 0x20, cannot be included in a name.\'"\nThe offending line of code is\n        <Item IsKit="false">\n\n...where the code in c# I have written is as below\n        XElement items = new XElement("Items");\n        items.Add(new XElement("Item IsKit =\\"false\\""\n\nI believe the issue is because there are spaces between the words \'Item\' and \'IsKit\'....my question is how I would get around this in order for this element to be added to my test code?\nHow to close the popup modal dialog box using selenium (Java) tool for the below screenshot?\n \nI\'m testing an API and I\'m looking to define my payload using classes so that my program can then deserialize/serialize into any format (namely XML in my case). Below is an example of the payload:\n     <Order>\n       <BillingAddress>\n         <AddressLine1></AddressLine1>\n         <AddressLine2></AddressLine2>\n         <City></City>\n       </BillingAddress>\n       <Items>\n         <Item IsKit="false">\n         <CountryVATRate></CountryVATRate>\n         <Group></Group>\n         <Reference></Reference>\n       </Item>\n       <Item IsKit="false">\n        <CountryVATRate>0.25</CountryVATRate>\n        <Group>5360693120</Group>\n        <Reference>5360693120</Reference>\n       </Item>\n     </Items>\n     <OrderAmount>35</OrderAmount>\n     <TimeStamp>2017-03-30 00:00:00.102</TimeStamp>\n    </Order>\n\nSo my thinking is that I would have an overall Order class which looks something like the below\n    public class Order()\n    {\n      BillingAddress bAddr; //another class\n      List Items;\n      double OrderAmount;\n      DateTime TimeStamp;\n     }\n\nWhat I am trying to work out is the best way of setting up my framework so that in the example of the BillingAddress class I can set up a series of properties e.g. AddressLine1/AddressLine1 etc which can then be called when I run the test\nAny advice on how to structure the test framework would be most appreciated\nScenario:\n1.Login to a website using script and navigate to the Home page.\n2.

Using Test Manager in VSTFS 2015, what are the best practices for test plan structure? The Team works with a Agile methodology in 2 week sprints. \nWhat criteria should be used when formulating the test plan for each sprint or making the plans more product & feature focused.  \nIt appears that a Product focus seems like the way to go, because then they can be re-used for Regression, etc. However I\'m concerned how easy that would be to maintain? \nWelcome all thoughts.\nI\'m not able to run my protractor tests.

I refer SoapUI own documentation resource for testing. But their is not discussed all features step by step properly. And not also discussed for advanced web service testing.\nPlease say some good resource  for web service testing with SoapUI not SoapUI pro.\nN.T- I will be thankful if anyone post his own web service testing process video tutorial with SoapUI not SoapUi pro.\nRecently we found a concurrency problem in our Web app. It came out that  a class in a third-party library is not thread-safe and when it is shared between multiple threads, then access to it must be somehow synchronized. This finding was a by-product of load testing of our Web application with many concurrent users.\nI wonder if for finding concurrency issues I should run more focused tests in addition to load tests? Or maybe it is enough to run traditional performance tests? Or maybe I should change something in performance tests so they detect such issues better? E.g., \n\nmake test scenarios more complex, including more endpoints in one scenario.\nrun threads with random delays to increase the chance of interesting interleavings between accessing the shared resource.\n\nI\'m using webdriver.Firefox and I\'m trying to send the following custom header:\nself.headers = { \'Authorization\': \'Basic %s\' % b64encode(bytes(self.args.user + \':\' + self.args.password, "utf-8")).decode("ascii") }\n\nin the following way:\nself.driver.get(self.base_url + "/", headers=self.headers)\n\nwhich is similar way as shown here, but I\'m guessing it\'s using completely different driver.\nHowever I\'ve the error:\nTypeError: get() got an unexpected keyword argument \'headers\'\n\nI\'ve checked the old issue #2047: How to add a header to a request?, but it\'s closed as duplicate of another Won\'t Fix issue.\nIs there any way of simply test the site using Selenium which is behind Basic Authentication?\nOne suggestion is to use proxy, however I don\'t believe such simple functionality doesn\'t exist.\nAny suggestions?\nShould we do negative test cases testing by automation. Generally I heard that we can do functional and regression automation. I am doing same. I am using selenium web driver for automation and doing all functional and regression testing using it. But thing is all tests are positive here.\nSo I would like to know that should we do automation for negative testing or it is better to do it manually? Because I think if we go for automation for negative testing then it will be lot of code to be done..\nFor Ex: I have register form and field is there called "Password" , Now validations for fields are "Password must be of minimum 6 characters and must contains letter,digit and special character"\nSo in above case positive automation will be easy as I will test direct by insert valid password , But for negative testing of that field will have lot of cases so should we do automation for that? \nPlease let me know best way for negative testing. Right now I am preferring manually.\nis there any way to test an application which is already installed For Eg. i want to test the calculator or google map application ?\nmy Current Appium version is 1.3.4.1\nI started work as junior QA and after 2 months of manual testing my boss told me to learn about automation. \nThe problem is that I should test app which has been written in JavaScript for Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows Mobile. I searched for topics on the internet but I didn\'t found anything interesting. \nDoes anyone have any advice?\nI have written some tests in Selenium using NodeJs and I am looking for a way to use those tests for stress testing web apps. Is there any tool that combined with selenium can do the trick?\nWhat I am actually looking for is a tool that is "Selenium like". Basically I want to open a webpage and execute custom javascript in the console to perform my tests. The extra part that selenium does not cover is running the test multiple simultaneous times.\nI am trying to download a file from a website using a webdriver. But my browser is shutting down before it was able to properly export. I inserted a wait() before I call dispose() but it is not waiting for the time I have specified.\nI am doing an implicit wait.\ndriver.Manage().Timeouts().ImplicitlyWait(new TimeSpan(0, 0, seconds));\n\nSeems to do nothing.\nAny ideas??\nIsn\'t end to end already tested when you do different levels of functional tests?\nFor example:\n1. Test A -> B (but to do this, need to do x -> z)\n2. Test C -> F (but to do this, need to do A -> B)\n3. and so on...\nI am going through some examples and some books in relation to Cucumber usage and it looks like @And annotation is never being caught by the regex. I mean it is a valid Gherkin keyword and it is being used in the scenarios but I can see no references to it in the actual code.\nWhy is that?\nI have a html div like this \n<div if="url" class="img-alt__graphic ng-scope" ng-style="ieCSSFilters" style="background-image: url(www.xxxxxxx.com;size=270x360);"></div>\n\nIn this div tag I don\'t have an id attribute, so how do I use the class attribute to check if the image is loaded or not? \nCode Snippet: \nimport org.openqa.selenium.By; \nimport org.openqa.selenium.JavascriptExecutor; \nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; \nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebElement; \nimport org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;\n\npublic class QA {\n    public WebDriver driver; \n    private String baseUrl;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) { \n        QA mv =new QA(); \n        mv.launch_test(); \n    }\n\n    public void launch_test() \n    { \n        driver = new FirefoxDriver(); \n        baseUrl = "http://www.optimum.net"; \n        driver.get(baseUrl);\n\n        WebElement image1 = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[contains(@class,\'global-header__brand\')]"));    \n\n        Boolean imageLoaded1 = (Boolean) ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("return arguments[0].complete && typeof arguments[0].naturalWidth != "undefined" && arguments[0].naturalWidth > 0", image1); \n        if (!imageLoaded1) \n        {\n            System.out.println("1. Image is not present"); \n        }\n        else \n        {\n            System.out.println("1. Got it"); \n        }\n\n        driver.close(); \n    }\n}\n\nWe have a lot of tests in QADirector. The largest of our 26 projects has more than 1100 test scripts. Since QADirector is no longer supported, I\'m looking for possible migration paths.\nThe only know migration path to me is to SilkCentral using the SilkCentral \nTestManager Migration Utility (PDF). However, we don\'t own a SilkCentral license (yet) and according to the feedback of the support, they have never migrated such a large database.\nAre there other alternatives for converting the tests of QADirector into a format matching any other test tool?\nI\'m aware the nature of this question could be flagged as "too broad". If your vote for "too broad", please proove your flag by mentioning at least one possible way in the comments - because I doubt there is more than one (if any) answer out there.\nI have been trying to mouse hover on element , first time it hover properly and hold but then never it does same. I can see that it is trying to hold hover but runs too fast and effect comes like just blink on element.\nMy code :\nWebElement hover =  driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id=\'frmDashboard\']/div[1]/div[1]/ul/li[4]/a"));\n\n Actions action = new Actions(driver);\n action.moveToElement(element).build().perform();\n\nI have tried all type of wait , sleep methods here but no success.\nI have made a Windows Forms app to host my GUI for running selenium tests. \nWhen the user presses the "run test" button, it launches an instance of chromedriver and runs the selected selenium test.\nHowever, let\'s say that while the test is running, the user decides they want to stop the test, or simply not have the entire test run. \nI have a button on the form that calls FixtureTearDown() in case this were to happen. FixtureTearDown is simply:\nif (_driver != null) _driver.Quit();\n\nHowever, if you DO press this "stop test" button, the driver closes, but the selenium test keeps executing the script as if the webdriver were still open, which then throws errors (because it can\'t find elements because the driver is closed, duh) and causes my Windows Forms app to crash.\nSo, is there a way to gracefully halt the running of a selenium script? Thanks in advance for the help, and i apologize if this is a dumb question, i am still new to selenium and c# in general.\nOur vision is to have central storage of consolidated test cases across all departments and to store it as a separate project in HP ALM. This would allow us to collect test cases across different projects and store it in a common project in HP ALM.\nIs this a good approach and what pro\'s / cons will it give us?\nMany projects are using BPT testing and some projects are  doing manual testing in HP ALM.\nWe are currently looking at Testrail as an alternative to using the Zephyr plugin within JIRA as Testrail looks to give us better test case and reporting management than Zephyr does.\nCurrently faced with the usual problem when changing tools of how to migrate our existing test cases from one to the other.\nI know there are importer tools to get Excel spreadsheet cases into Testrail, so that is ok. The problem I\'m facing is how to get the test scripts out of Zephyr.\nDoes anyone know of any similar plugins to export test cases/scripts from Zephyr to Excel?\nI\'ve tried using the inbuilt export function, but it only seems to export the basic case details, not the individual test steps.\nAny help greatly appreciated.\nThe HTTP Request I used in my performance testing uses JMeter\'s XPath Extractor in order to get the response data of the HTTP Request. \nWhen the test ran, the response data for the same HTTP request is different. \nWhat could cause this to happen?\nI\'m currently adding some users and then wanted to check if that one user made it in the dropdown, and if it does make it, then select it. \nIf it doesn\'t make it in the dropdown, I want it so spit out an error but don\'t want it to stop the script, just to go to another part of the script (and continue looping).\n]\nin my project I started code coverage for unit and integration test with gradle + jacoco. It\'s already working and generating reports.\nI saw a lot of questions and tutorials about how to do code coverage for both tests, but I didn\'t see any question about why do code coverage for integration test. Which type of data do we expect for integration test (code coverage)? The same as unit test?\nWhy I\'m asking this: On unit test, we explicit call methods, objects and other system under test code. In this scenario, jacoco understand this and do a metric for code coverage based on what methods/properties is being called. And this is ok, makes sense to me. But on integration test, I only use some model classes to use in test and jacoco only report this models as being code coverage but not the methods being used during the tests.\nMakes sense to do a code coverage for integration test? Which type of data do we expect? Or my integration test code coverage is wrong?\nI developed a web service for uploading files to the server, this web service will be used by 45k users approximately. \nI started to load test my application with JMeter and I\'m a newbie in software performance.\nI tested with different values in Thread Group (Number of Threads and Rump-Up Period) ex: 1000 and 200, 1000 and 300. I see always all requests response are "200 OK" but I don\'t find all requests files stored in the folder (generally the number of files found is equal to the Rump-Up Period).\nAny help, please?    \nHello I\'m having a slight issue. I\'m using selenium to make a report through ExtentReport which saves a HTML file. I want to be able to save this file dynamically.\nThis is the code im currently using.\nreport = new ExtentReports("/Users/xxxx/Desktop/ExtentReport/ExtentReport.html" + System.currentTimeMillis());\n\nAdding System.CurrentTimeMills kind of works as it saves it but it ends up being ExtentReport.html1919191919191919191 which works. \nThe problem that I have is that after I run my selenium test I want it to navigate to the folder and open the HTML as soon as the test is over.\nIf I use currentTime then I can\'t open the file as it is made and called about a minute inbetween giving different file names.\nThis is the code I use to call it after the test is over.\nString Path ="file:/Users/xxxxx/Desktop/ExtentReport/ExtentReport.html" + System.currentTimeMillis();\ndriver.get(Path);\n\nHow can I save my html file dynamically whilst still being able to call it later on during my script to open?\nI\'m preparing myself to exam of ISTQB Advanced Level - Technical Test Analyst. I\'ve just finished the chapter and after that I still can\'t answer on questions asked on the beginning of it. I.e. I\'m not sure about my answers. \nSo, I\'d like to ask you to verify my responses:\n\n\nExplain the stages in an application\'s lifecycle where non-functional tests and architecture based-test tests may be applied.\n  Explain the causes of non-functional testing taking place only in\n  specific stages of application\'s lifecycle.\n\n\nNon-functional tests can be applied in any stage of an application\'s lifecycle. Some of non-functional characteristic like efficiency depends of quality of a single components. Therefore execution efficiency should be already tested at the unit or integration level.\nSome non-functional testing does not have sense until late in the Software Development Life Cycle. It is not possible to measure a characteristic like usability before the product is not integrated into one system. \n(I don\'t understand what does architecture based-test tests mean. Can someone explain this term for me?)\n\n\nGive examples of the criteria that influence the structure and level of test condition development\n\n\n\nIf you have a marketing requirements document and a system requirements document then you can use the former to generate high-level test conditions and then use the latter to elaborate same low-level test conditions underneath each high-level one.\nQuality risk analyst - we can outline the key features and quality characteristics at a high level. These quality risk items are thus the test high-level test conditions\n\n\n\nDescribe how test analysis and design are static testing techniques that can be used to discover defects.\n\n\nThe process of test analysis and design needs to precise understanding the requirements specification, design specification, or other documents used as input into process. It allows identify defects in the documentation. \n\n\nExplain by giving examples the concept of the test oracle and how a test oracle can be used in test specifications\n\n\nTo be honest, I don\'t understand this exercise. How the test oracle can be used to test a specifications? English is not my native language, it is a problem. \nI have checked YouTube & Google for solutions to this error.

I work in a medical industry web application. I was assigned a module to test. I did a lot of research and risk analysis and logged at least 25 bugs/problems. Now I think that the developers are mad at me, as it indicates that their coding is not good enough and is a direct attack on their work efficiency, quality, and productivity. I see that they don\'t talk to me and are ignoring me. I have increased their work. They have fixed a few bugs but want to reject others. I have filed GUI defects, business process flow issues, etc.\nShould I stop filing too many bugs in the future, as it will show that I just file them without researching, just to get noticed? It seems like I want to increase the bug count.\nI am using selenium webdriver under python on a Debian jessie machine. The browser I am currently testing is Chrome (version 55) with chromedriver (version 2.27).\nIf I send the string 1/2/3 to a textarea input with send_keyswhat gets inserted is 321.\nNote that when I use the Firefox geckodriver, I do not see this behavior. \nUPDATE: After some more investigation, I believe my problems lies with my Windows/X-windows communication. Some detail: for testing I normally open a Cygwin X-Windows session on my Windows desktop, ssh into a Linux server inside that X-windows session, and run the Selenium tests on that Linux server. This is where I see the strange problem with the forward slashes. However, when I run the tests directly on the Linux server with its own X-Windows session, the problem goes away. But I really want this testing to work with the Windows environment, so I still need a solution.\nI have my selenium test send an email whenever there is an error, this is hard coded into my test however I am looking to see if it is possible to call it from an external file so I can just edit the Email file instead of having to go into the code and change it.\nThe way i\'m getting it to email is\ntry {\n\n}\ncatch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n    new SendMail("senderemail","reciveremail",e); } \n}\n\nWhich calls it directly from:\npublic SendMail(String fromMail,String tomail, Exception e ) {\n    Properties props = new Properties();\n    props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com");\n    props.put("mail.smtp.socketFactory.port", "465");\n    props.put("mail.smtp.socketFactory.class","javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory");\n    props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");\n    props.put("mail.smtp.port", "465");\n    Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(props, new javax.mail.Authenticator() {\n        protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {\n            return new PasswordAuthentication("xxxxxxx","xxxxxx");\n\nQuestion: How can I get my selenium to get a list from an external file of emails to send them out?\n\nEdit: Updated code of what finally works.\nString fileName = "/Users/cdolan/Desktop/liness.txt";\nString Email = "";\n\ntry(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName)) {  \n    while ((Email = br.readLine()) !=null) {\n        <Test code here goes here>\n    }\n}\ncatch(Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n    new SendMail("email123@gmail.com",Email,e); }\n}\n\nI\'m automating the input to a search bar; the program work fine when using chrome driver, but fails when I try to use PhantomJS.\nThe text that should go in the search bar is not being typed properly:\nWebElement searchBar =  driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input.sbox-ui-input"));\n\nsearchBar.sendKeys(query);\nutil.waitFor(3); // we wait to get all the possible suggestions\nsearchBar.sendKeys(Keys.ENTER);\n\nI also tried this code:\nActions action = new Actions(driver);\naction.sendKeys(searchBar, query).build().perform();\n\nNone of them are working. Is there another way to \'type\' the text in the input/search bar?\nI often had a similar problem when clicking certain buttons, so I had a script like this that worked with PhantomJS:    \nWebElement commentsRecent = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("button.someButtonClass")).get(1);\nJavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor)driver;\njs.executeScript("arguments[0].click();", commentsRecent);\n\nIs there something similar for sending text input?\nThe AUT is built with LAMP* Stack and is the Intranet Home app and is going to be used by almost all employees of a large corporation. \nApplication Performance Testing is carried out using HPE suite of tools (LoadRunner).\nThe average user load is determined to be 150 users, average hourly page views is determined to be approx 4000/hour and we already did an endurance test as described below:\n\nRamp up 75 users, 2 every 20 seconds \nRun for 6 hours \nRamp down 30 users from it simultaneously\nRun the 45 users for another 4 hours \nRamp down another 15 users simultaneously\nRun for another 2 hours with the users(30) left\nThen ramp up another 45 users and repeat above steps for next 12 hours.\n\nI have two questions:\n\nWhat is wrong with the above strategy?  Should we have run\nthe test for a lower transaction target but using the same number as\nbaseline (150) users? \nWhat should be the key metrics we should\nbe looking for as a part of the endurance test? Where should we be looking for answers? I am not talking\nabout \'Long Term Application stability\' kind of answers. More\ndetails would definitely help\n\n*LAMP Stack - Drupal, Varnish & Redis for Caching, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB mostly on Oracle Linux.\nLet me know if you would like more details. \nThanks for all the help so far.\nI want to perform penetration testing and assess the network traffic using a packet analyzer. Which tool is used by most people? How does it compare to other Applications, what is the state-of-the-art?\nIs Wireshark the right choice as a network packet analyzer? How does it differ from an penetration-testing framework like e.g. metasploit?\nWhat other applications are there?\nWhat would be the Xpath to get the background-image CSS Property of a DIV tag whose ID is mentioned in Selenium Webdriver?\nExample: \n<div id="abc", style="width: 538px !important; height: 242px !important; background-image: url(http://test.com/images/abc.png); position: relative; background-position: 0% 0%;>\n\nI want to find this image with url: http://test.com/images/abc.png\nI need to find a program that can take a list of url\'s and actually run them to see where they go. For example:\nTake - www.example.com and see if it goes to www.example.com (no error/redircts) or if it goes to a redirect (i.e. sub.example.com) or if it throws a error such as 404, & 500.\nThe list is about 900 domains long and we used to copy and paste each one into a browser and see what the end result was, then document what it returned. This has now become a pain since the client base is increasing extremely fast. A desktop app would be ideal, we would have to consider web apps.\nThanks\nTestLink has field name - Execution Type which could be set for test case. It could be marked as Manual or Automated. I am keen to find a report on this field but did not see any similar report on execution type. There are test case reports for Failed Test Cases, Blocked Test Cases and Not run Test Cases but no test report on execution type. The report on "Execution Type" could give overall picture on how many tests are automated in a plan. (though I know that not many agree with such statistics). \nIs there a way to generate report on Execution Type in TestLink\nI am trying to create a Selenium Web driver java code where I can find all the hidden objects on the webpage and can be accessed. I want the count of all those hidden objects. Which property I can use in the code which can identify hidden objects because when I thought of using get Element by property so that i can search for objects with hidden property, it was not there. Is there anything i am missing here. Is it really possible ? Or do we need to know the id of the element to be found ? Any Inputs will be useful. \nI am newbie to Test Automation.Currently I got an oppurtunity to work with selenium Web driver.I just want to know whether I need to learn Database like MYSQL,OR ORACLE to work with selenium.\nAlso I need to know whether any need comes if I need to create queries for making automation script more power full.?\nIf you\'re a dev and I\'m the tester, do you expect me to...\n\nAs soon as I find a bug, tell you about it or make a summary of bugs found and tell you about it at the end of the day?\nAsk you tons of questions about the app you\'re developing or try to figure it out myself? Or maybe I shouldn\'t have to worry about the specific details of the app?\netc\n\nIn short, do devs like being bothered by testers? If the answer is yes, where is the line I shouldn\'t cross?\nWorking with programmers and customers I find it is sometimes harder for me to verify the fix for a defect, than to fix a defect for a developer.\nJust a simple example is when there is NullPointerException thrown by a method. A bug report contains no steps to reproduce the issue, just a stacktrace. Given such a poor report, a developer corrects the code so the method swallows such exceptions or re-write the method. Then he marks the defect as fixed. \nAs a tester I usually care more about the context. Why null values arrived to the method? Which component produced it and why? So simply swallowing the exception is not a solution: it probably did\'t removed the error. Rather it masked it.\nThis kind of problems usually happens, when someone else reported a bug (not me), for instance a customer representative, and I see the bug report only when verifying the fix.\nSo it all boils down to the quality of bug report. If steps to reproduce weren\'t written before fixing the bug, they must be identified after the fix. And then it is often hard to do it, because I need to check-out/setup two system versions from SVN: one before the fix, and another after the fix was committed.\nSo how can we improve the process?\n\nShouldn\'t testers and devs complete the bug report with steps to reproduce before fixing it? I don\'t care who will do it, but I think such a step should be present in the bug lifecycle here.\nIf devs and testers cannot collect information from customer to reproduce the bug, should they patch it (as in the example above) or reject a bug report as "cannot reproduce"?\n\nEDIT: Maybe I wasn\'t clear enough. I haven\'t asked how to write a good bug report. I\'m rather looking for practical ways to make devs, customer representative, business analysts, me, etc. complete a bug report as it goes through our hands. Some solutions other have proposed so far:\n\nintroduce templates in bug reports\nreview good and bad reports with stakeholders to demonstrate how they help or hinder reproducing bugs and fixing them\ngently ask customer for more details (talking to a customer seems a separate art to me), particularly for what they did before the failure occurred. \n\nParticularly, I haven\'t seen any answer what a dev should provide in a bug report after fixing the bug? Root cause? What areas were touched? How were they changed? In which revision change was committed?  \nHow effective is Visual studio test suite than load runner?\nI would like to learn performance/load test a web application, but i got really confused to choose which tool to go for. \nDoes the scope of VSTS 2010 is better than Loadrunner, considering the cost of the license too? \nPS: I\'m new to performance testing, please recommend a tool which is good for a beginner. I tried Jmeter but its just a long way to go.\nIs JMeter designed to only record web browser traffic, or can it record http requests made by installed programs as well? \nI set up JMeter as per these instructions and I do not see the web traffic of a particular application installed on my computer. I\'ve set up the proxy settings in my system settings.\nI am interested in learning Selenium Webdriver.\nCan anyone please let me know where I can find the selenium tutorials?\nSelenium RC: Xpath of the link is changed when I refresh the page, and when I run the code it shows "Exception in thread "main" com.thoughtworks.selenium.SeleniumException: ERROR: Element //*[@id=\'yui-gen79\'] not found".\nHow do I handle this error?\nFirst:\n//*[@id=\'yui-gen79\']\n\nAfter\n//*[@id=\'yui-gen98\']\n\nPage code\n<document>\n<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">\n<head>\n<body id="Share" class="yui-skin-default alfresco-share js">\n<div/>\n<div id="overlay" style="display: none; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; z-index: 90; width: 100%;">\n<div id="lightbox" style="display: none; position: absolute; z-index: 100;">\n<span class="yui-resize-status"/>\n<span class="yui-resize-status"/>\n<span class="yui-resize-status"/>\n<span class="yui-resize-status"/>\n<div id="page_x002e_component-2-2_x002e_user_x007e_sf-er-ro_x007e_dashboard_x0023_default-metadataTooltip" class="yui-module yui-overlay yui-tt yui-overlay-hidden" style="z-index: 2; visibility: hidden;">\n<div id="page_x002e_component-2-2_x002e_user_x007e_sf-er-ro_x007e_dashboard_x0023_default-previewTooltip" class="yui-module yui-overlay yui-tt yui-overlay-hidden" style="z-index: 2; width: 108px; visibility: hidden;">\n<iframe id="_yuiResizeMonitor" title="Text Resize Monitor" tabindex="-1" role="presentation" style="position: absolute; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; border-width: 0px; width: 2em; height: 2em; left: 0px; top: -33px;"/>\n<div class="sticky-wrapper">\n<div id="doc3">\n<div id="alf-hd">\n<div id="alf-full-width">\n<div id="bd">\n<div class="yui-gd grid columnSize2">\n<div class="yui-u first column1">\n<div id="page_x002e_component-1-1_x002e_user_x007e_sf-er-ro_x007e_dashboard">\n<div id="page_x002e_component-1-1_x002e_user_x007e_sf-er-ro_x007e_dashboard_x0023_default">\n<script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[ (function() {    new Alfresco.dashlet.MySites("page_x002e_component-1-1_x002e_user_x007e_sf-er-ro_x007e_dashboard_x0023_default").setOptions(    {       imapEnabled: false,       listSize: 100    }).setMessages({"empty.title": "Quickly access your sites", "filter.favSites": "My Favorites", "filter.all": "All", "empty.description": "A site is a project area where you can share and discuss content with other site members.", "dashlet.help": "<p>Sites are project areas where you collaborate with others, sharing content and working on it together.

We don\'t have much (or any) control of the deployed environment, hence the only way to test our integration is truly working is using browser automation on the client\'s webpage.  We don\'t want to interfere with our tracking and analytics, and more importantly, the client\'s analytics (which is very important to verifying their ROI). What is the most convenient and effective way to block Google Analytics in the context of selenium browser automation?\nI have found a few approaches:\n\nGoogle Analytics Opt Out Browser Add On\nEditing the hosts file to redirect Google Analytics to localhost  (I\'m not too happy about this solution since in the past it has broken some of our integration files)\nOther browser specific extensions, Block yourself from GA extension for Chrome and Google Disconnect for Firefox.\n\nThe situation\nI need to start building automated regression for a very large web application with thousands of users. It is impossible to start from a known state, or even to be sure that data entered into the application will be saved to a known state. The application is a payroll entry system, where all data is read only if payroll has not been started, and has an insane number of configuration choices.\nThe application can\'t be run on a local database with a local setup: it requires multiple interlocking web services (which use - don\'t ask me why - the system registry to determine where to submit their results) and is not practical to reset (a database refresh can take all day). The test sandbox environment can be accessed by multiple users and configurations changed in ways that completely alter the expected behavior of the system. the development sandbox environment is often out of action for days at a time when large projects are being worked on.\nThe strategies I see as viable\nThe potential strategies I\'m considering are:\n\nSet my initial conditions first - This is - alas - a bit more complex than it looks. I would need to make either several database queries or do a number of screenscrapes to determine whether the company has had its configuration changed, and whether I need to start a payroll run, change the configuration back to what it should be, then submit the false run before starting a clean run with the correct configuration. This would also complicate end-of-test checks because I would then need to find and discard the initial submit file in order to check the validity of the one with the data my tests actually entered. On the plus side, the values saved to the pending transaction tables prior to submit and the contents of the submit file would match expectations.\nDynamic checking of results - by this I mean the much more complex coding needed to check results based on which configuration flags are active when I test, regardless of whether they\'re what I expect to see. The advantages I see here are that I wouldn\'t need to try to force the system to the settings I was starting with, and I\'d be building in an oblique check that certain fields display only when certain configuration flags are enabled. On the flip side, this is a great deal more complicated to code properly, and as a result, much more error-prone.\nHybrid approach - where I set certain key values but let the rest do whatever someone else set them to. This would give me some of the disadvantages of each method, but would allow me to limit the extra complexity to areas that tend to be moving targets anyway. \n\nSome other considerations\nI have (after six months experience with the system) a reasonable grasp of where the system interacts with web services (these are all built and maintained in-house, but tend not to get much development. They also typically get called from the web application or poll the web application database, so testing them separately isn\'t on the agenda at this stage). The web services are integral to the system to an extent that it\'s not possible to simply test only the web application. \nThe application is written is classic ASP. There is no way to separate front end and business logic. It is not unit tested because it is not unit testable. While there is a plan to replace it with a better engineered system, I will be testing this system for at least another 2 years, potentially longer. \nGiven these "interesting" complexities, what approach should I take to building automated regression for this application? \nTerminology Update\nIn response to @user246 requesting clarification of some of the terminology I used:\n\nsubmit the false run - by this I mean to submit a payroll that contains nothing but a change of configuration settings where I don\'t actually care what gets sent. \nsubmit file - This one is a bit more complex. All the calculation logic and check generation logic happens in a back end server I have no access to. My only interface to the back end server is a fixed length format text file: the submit file. This file is generated for every payroll submission, with a defined naming convention. When there is more than one payroll submission in a short timeframe for a given customer, it can be difficult to find the one that contains the information I\'m interested in.\npending transaction tables - between the start of a payroll run and submitting the run, everything that happens is recorded to one of a number of database tables. They\'re known as the pending transaction tables because changes to configuration, payroll, and personnel data are not final until everything has been synched between the web application and the back end server. Until a payroll run is submitted, changes aren\'t permanent, and depending on the logic involved can exist only in the pending transaction tables.\n\nSeveral of my team\'s QC users have complained about the text in description & comments fields being too small to read.

Our intranet-application is written in PHP. I was able to get Selenium working with PHPUnit but for me it looks like PHP is really uncommon. All books and most of the other stuff I found on the net are using Selenium together with Java.\nSo my questions are:\n\nDoes it really make sense to use Selenium with PHP or do I have to\nlearn Jave or C#? \nWhere can I find the most information related to    Selenium together\nwith PHP? I understand the object oriented model of    PHP but I\'m\nnot a very strong developer..\nIs there something better than Selenium to automated testing a PHP application (GUI tests)?\n\nI know how to check values and create tests and do the error handling if something fails, but what I din\'t found anywhere was the following:\nA test case tests specific things. But what when unexpected errors occurs which arent a covered by a specific check of a test? Is it possible to set something like a "watchdog for error messages" up or is the only way to get this done to create a function which is called after every step?\nI\'m using Selenium together with PHP/PHPUnit (but not integrated into the application which I test itself). Any "best practises" or hints to get this done are very welcome.\nI\'m the guy who is motivated to bring some quality assurance into our team. The problem is, that our developers very often hate testing and even if they have a test protocol, not all of them are really testing. Very often they are asking their colleagues instead of testing themselves where the bugs were and practices like this. They are very often not very interested to do a good job.\nThis is of course a general problem and they could got fired for such an attitude. But in reality things aren\'t as simple as this.\nMy question now is if there are clever tactics which prevent them from cheating. I would let some random errors occur for each tester to prevent it, but as they are the developers it\'s nearly impossible to prevent searching the source code for these errors. Another idea would be to offer a reward for the person who found the most bugs. Or don\'t let multiple people test the same things (but this reduces the quality of the tests).\nWhat are your clever suggestions to "force" the developers to really test and give them no possibility to cheat? Funny tactics are of course welcome too...\nIn my situation the application is written in PHP and the developers are the testers too (same persons).\nPlease help that how to implement the ISO standards in SOFTWARE QUAILTY"" if any one has any template about these, share me please.

But afterwards the client will usually have "design" issues. IE this needs to be padded 75x pixels to the right, or this image needs to be stretched etc.\nAlso, I am human...so there are things im going to miss. But just given the time (Aka a once over)...I guess I always feel bad about these kinds of things.\nSo my questions is:\n\nThings are expected to slip through if you are just given a once through correct? Im not talking about a lot of major stuff. But little things (especially if it\'s a large website). How do I not beat myself up over this?\nWhat can you do about design things? Is QA expected to notice these things? (Especially without reference).

I set up a load test that simulated the conditions and verified my findings and sent it back to Development. While this was a performance issue and a performance test, this type of scenario could potentially uncover a functional issue.\nI wanted to test Salesforce Lightning application by capturing JSON request and response with Selenium WebDriver or any?\nIs there any way to do it, if so how?\nI\'m fairly new to this subject. Out of different literature I\'m understanding what I show in the image below.\nMy understanding is first you have to create test plan, After test plan you have to create test cases, but this is dependent on the testing techniques that you are using, like you see in the image below.\nAm I understanding this correctly?\n\nI am running e2e tests using Protractor on a VM through azure.  I want to run tests on multiple browsers, which Protractor allows me to do by adding a list like this (from the protractor.config file):\nmultiCapabilities: [\n   {\'browserName\': \'internet explorer\'},\n   {\'browserName\': \'chrome\'}\n]\n\nAnd I can add more browsers to that list.  However, when protractor launches it runs both browsers in parallel, which is great for saving time but I believe it is too much for this VM to handle and is causing some tests to timeout.  How can I tell protractor to run the test on each browser I specify in series rather than parallel?\nI am using selenium IDE 2.9.1. I\'m opening Test case recorded earlier for making changes in it, but I\'m unable to see the commands in the Table view though I can see the HTML code in the source view.\nCan you guide and suggest me how to view the earlier recorded scripts?\nIn coded UI is there a way to set the value of a ComboBox using the value of Value Attribute. Consider the following Html of a ComboBox:\n<select name="ParametersID" tabindex="-1" title="ABC" class="form-control select-control select2-offscreen" id="Parameters_ID" autocomplete="off" data-val="true" data-val-number="This is a sample HTML" data-sets=\'["A","B","C","D","E","F"]\' data-placeholder="Select only one">\n  <option value=""></option>\n      <option value="7311">A</option>\n      <option value="7312">B</option>\n      <option value="7313">C</option>\n      <option value="7314">D</option>\n      <option value="7315">E</option>\n</select>\n\nI want to set value of Html ComboBox using the values 7311, 7312 etc. not by the text "A", "B" etc.\nI found that we properties like SelectedItem (to select using the text value) and SelectedIndex (to select by Index). \nSelectedItem: Currently I am using this option, it is good but it is not that reliable. Since, text values inside dropdown can be updated from Admin pages. Also, these text values depends upon language selected by user.\nSelectedIndex: This doesn\'t fit to any of my requirement, because I don\'t know which value will be at what index position.\nThere is a property "ValueAttribute" but it is only for getting the value not for set.\nBy my research so far, IE  selenium webdriver (for IE10 or 11) is not able to retrieve httponly cookies.\nSo code like this can return a full set of cookies including those set to httponly if I am using Chrome or FF driver \nself.driver.get_cookies()\n\nHowever for the IE driver, thehttponly cookies will be missing from the result\nI just want to confirm it is the behaviour as of now, and if there is any workaround other than unsetting the httponly flag on the server side.\nP.S. Unable to create new \'IE\' tag so tagging this question with ie9\n(First question here ...)\nI\'m a software engineer, and in my team I\'m also in charge of checking all logged errors that our servers or "fat clients" produce. When I see something new, I\'m meant to fill-in a bug report, which, if at all possible, should include steps to reproduce the bug.\nMy question is: how can I try to reproduce bugs that arise from IO errors while reading/writing files (most likely due to either defect drives (USB sticks?), or unreliable network drives)?\nIt must be so that some drive/directory is visible and accessible from the "fat client" (Java), and only when trying to read or write from it do we get an error.\nI\'m aware of automation tools like- Selenium, Appium, Selendroid.\nIs there any other tool available in the market which is used for automation testing outside of the selenium group?\nI am trying to create a simple Selenium script to login to a page directly proceeded by logging out from the page. I am using Selenium with C# and PageFactory to reach the elements on the webpage.\nI am able to login to the page, but unable to logout. The login and logout button themselves are made visible by clicking the loginLogoutElementMakeVisible element seen below. This element changes after logging in. \nMy current solution is to have one reference to the element in my code as seen below:\n[Findsby(How = How.CssSelector, Using = "a[href=\'javascript:void(0)\']")]\npublic IWebElement loginLogoutElementMakeVisible\nHtml for the button to make login button visible:\n<li class="nav-link sm-menu-item more">\n<a data-bind="click: function(){ loginClicked(true); }, text: translate(\'menu_login\')" href="javascript:void(0)">Login</a>\n</li>\n\nHtml for the button to make logout button visible:\n<li class="nav-link sm-menu-item more nav-profile">\n    <a href="javascript:void(0)">\n        <img data-bind="attr: { \'src\': avatarUrl }" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_200_200/p/1/000/1c2/3a6/04b3e5c.jpg">\n    </a>\n    <ul class="submenu sm-submenu">\n</li>\n\nThe general concept I have used is to have these two action methods in the page object to login and logout.\npublic void Login()\n{\n    loginLogoutElementMakeVisible.Click();\n    loginUsernameEntry.Clear();\n    loginUsernameEntry.SendKeys("Username");\n    loginPasswordEntry.Clear();\n    loginPasswordEntry.SendKeys("Password");\n    loginExecuteButton.Click(); //Now logging in\n    Browser.WaitForPageReload() //Own code in Browser class see below (1)\n}\n\npublic void Logout()\n{\n    loginLogoutElementMakeVisible.Click(); //Never clicked in test\n    logoutExecuteButton.Click() //Now logging out\n}\n\nIn Browser class (1) ->\npublic void WaitForPageReload()\n{\n    IWait<IWebDriver> wait = new OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI.WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30.00));\n\n    wait.Until(driver1 => ((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript("return document.readyState").Equals("complete"));\n}\n\nI have also tried creating two separate fieldmember WebElements (e.g. one loginElementMakeVisible and one logoutElementMakeVisible) for the button to display the login and the logout button, but still having them in the same page object and thus initializing them at the same time (Thought this could work since pagefactory uses lazy loading)\nI have also tried to have the logout button in another pageobject which is initialized after login in the test.\nIs there a way to make the pagefactory update its proxy to the loginLogoutElementMakeVisible so I can logout? Or am I still trying to logout before the page after logging has had a chance to load? Are there other problems which could explain why I cannot click the MakeVisible element?\nI have recently been tasked with comparing our current release process with any existing compliance standards or other best practice standards to see what we are doing right, and what we might need to revisit.  My first thought is to examine ISO-9000 or SOX or CWE, but I really am not sure where to start. So my question for this community is this:\nWhat Official Standards are there that govern, or speak to, a web-based software release process?  \nTIA!\nI have some experience as a manual tester and at my current work our regression testing takes about 2 days.\nI am planning to start automating some of the test cases. I am looking at some of the free open-source tools available or cheap tools, I tried Sikuli but it only works for certain cases and most of the time it fails during object recognition.\nI have been suggested AutoIt and I am going to check that out too. I have some knowledge of Python so are there any tools which I can use for test automation of desktop application where I can use Python as a scripting language?\nAny other tool recommendation (preferably open source)?\nWhen I try to run my Android instrumented on Google Cloud Platform I get the error:\n\nYour test artifact is not an android artifact\n\nMy app is a Widget and I wonder if that\'s the reason?

I waited for a long time to allow the pending requests to complete, but Jmeter threw an exception with "Socket.timeout". \nCan any one help me in understanding what the problem is. Am I lagging somewhere to understand the possible reason?\nSo... I have no idea why (well, probably Javascript) but here are the different issues with the code below.\n\nWith a visibility/enabled wait, Selenium executes the Click() but it doesn\'t do anything on the page (scripts not yet loaded?). Or sometimes ShouldBeClickable() even returns a StaleElementException because the page is still loading.\nWith a JQuery.Active == 0 wait, I get the same result: it returns True immediately.\nWith a hard coded wait of 1 second, the page acts correctly.\n\nWhat other options do I have?\n        Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch();\n        sw.Start();\n        IJavaScriptExecutor js = (IJavaScriptExecutor)Browser.Driver;\n\n        while (true)\n        {\n            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Loop!");\n            if (sw.Elapsed.Seconds > 15) throw new Exception("Timeout");\n            if ((bool)js.ExecuteScript("return jQuery.active == 0"))\n            {\n                // Final wait while initializing new elements\n                System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Done!");\n                //System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000);\n                break;\n            }\n            //System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(200);\n        }\n        //System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000);\n        btnNext.ShouldBeClickable();\n        btnNext.Click();\n\nI am using Sikuli to automate a mainframe screen, I need to copy a text on screen and use that as input to another screen.\nI cannot find any option on the SIKULI IDE to do the copy function.\nMy question is, is it possible at all to copy text ?\nIs Ramp-up time in Jmeter affects concurrency ? I have 100 Threads in thread group and Ramp up time as 20. Will these 100 threads concurrent if ramp-up time is 20 Seconds?\nAs per theory, I have observed that Jmeter initiates thread after few seconds(depending on ramp up time).\nIf ramp up time is greater than 1 second, can I assume that number of threads set into the thread group are not concurrent?? \nWhat exactly does Guerilla Testing cover?\nWhat can be done in Guerilla Testing?\n\nWhy is Guerilla Testing used?\n\nIs Guerilla Testing especially for UX Design?\nI am trying to implement Cucumber in my current project with TestNG and I need to execute my script parallely on multiple browsers.\n\nIs Parallel Testing possible in Cucumber?

I\'ve also looked online for suggestions and I\'ve come across a few tools such as http://exporttfs2excel.codeplex.com/ but this only seems to work for older versions and won\'t connect to the TFS server. \nI\'ve also tried using the team section on Excel but I\'m only able to export my cases, but this is much help as they are not showing which requirement they relate to.\nHas anyone ran into this issue and found a workaround?\nFor non-functional requirements as performance, one can find simple metrics to measure the software quality. If you want to know, for example, if your system\'s performance got better or worse after some code changes, you can compare the time taken to perform certain actions (ideally all actions) before and after these changes.\nFor functional requirements, however, whether the system got better or worse since the previous version is a more subjective issue. A simple comparison of the number of failed test cases across versions may bring misleading results, as this does not account for the importance of the test case nor the impact of the problem on the user experience. One could even try to give appropriate weights to the test cases according to their importance, but I think the rules to assign the weights would themselves be subjective.\nWhat kind of metrics can be used as an indicative of how well a piece of software meets its functional requirements? \nAs a developer my knowledge of best QA practices, etc., are limited to know just enough to get me by writing unit tests, etc. \nFrom a tester\'s point of view, what testing procedures should the developer ideally have gone through before signing off a project to the QA team to be tested? \nObviously this will vary based on what development methodology is in place, so different answers based on different methodologies would be fantastic. I don\'t want to step on any toes but at the same time I don\'t want to be passing over completely untested code.\nBased on my first sentence, should I just sharpen up my knowledge in this field?\nI am testing an embedded system consisting of multiple processors working in different speeds, with different resources, all communicating through dedicated channels using a proprietary message protocol.\nThe unit under test are the mentioned channels. There is no insight into the actual data over them (those are internal buses, so scopes or logic analyzers can\'t be used) I am using a top-down approach using high level tests to infer that the underlying code is really working.\nAnyone tested similar systems and can share tips on testing ?\nVersion control for test assets is a no brainer, but dropping a Rational Functional Tester directly into VC hasn\'t been easy.  Attempting to use a tool like Subversion with multiple users modifying the same project has exposed issues with corrupted object maps and required additional reformatting of these maps when committing to avoid this problem.  Can anyone provide a good method or tool that they use to keep their RFT project versioned properly?\nUPDATE: One of the major issues we noticed with using Subversion and the RFT project was that merging changes to the object map by more than one person had problems.  The map is kept as a single line XML file, so when two different resources change it and Subversion attempts the merge, it fails when comparing the two single line XML files. We discovered a way around this with some reformatting, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution.\nAt my firm, we don\'t really have a QA department. If you\'ve followed some of my other questions you know essentially, we have no automated tests and our \'testers\' are the analysts who design the projects.\nWhen I recently brought up the idea of a more formal (I actually used the term \'industry standard\') QA department, I was told "The decision was made to go to a lean development process." Turns out that decision was made about 7 or 8 years ago. Only in the last 5 months have I convinced them to move to a 2 week deploy cycle (it was 3-4 months before) and only in the last month are they cutting a \'build\' that goes for the \'testers\' to test. Also, any changes necessary are made to that \'build\' (the code is able to be compiled or interpreted, so modification is easy.) The reason \'build\' is in quotes is because it\'s really just a copy of trunk, with the most recent changes put higher up in the path so they get found first, and it all gets interpreted on the fly.\nSo, it seems there\'s a fundamental misunderstanding of what "lean development" is. They had a QA department in the past, but were bothered by their lack of productivity. Of course, we know that a QA department isn\'t \'productive\'. If you look at it from a manufacturing point of view (which they do,) QA by definition hinders productivity by increasing the chance of failed and extended-time projects. (We\'ve tried using the argument that QA for software is like QA for the products they manufacture. They don\'t see it the same way because there\'s government mandates for their QA, but not for the software.)\nHow can I convince them that a formal QA will benefit the company?\nI\'ve seen testers (Michael Bolton, mainly) make a distinction between "testing" (looking for defects using a variety of different methods) and "checking" (running a scenario and then verifying a set of facts which, if false, imply a defect in the product).  Under these definitions, checking is a subset of testing.  \nExamples:  Most automated regression tests would be "checking".  Manual testing that doesn\'t go "off the rails" would be manual checking, but as soon as a tester leaves a script and starts investigating other behavior, they\'ve started exploratory testing.  Ad-hoc testing would not be checking.  Fuzzing and stability testing would normally not be "checks", but automated exploratory tests.\nI feel like there are a number of cases where people say, "Tests should have feature X", but then there are 10 exceptions to the rule.  However, many of these statements seem to be truer and clearer when stated as "Checks should have feature X".  For example, "Given the same inputs, automated checks should always produce the same outputs unless there is a change to the code."  However, there are many tests (stability, performance, semi-random input, etc.) that would naturally have some level of variation in their outputs that are useful but do not meet this criteria.  However, I also can see how this distinction could seem overly pedantic.  \nConcluding question, or,\nTL;DR: Is the idea of "checking" as a subset of testing a useful one?\nP.S. Edits to link articles / sources for this concept will be appreciated, if anyone here knows what I\'m talking about.\nP.P.S.  What I\'m trying to get at is, \'Is a distinction between "testing" vs. "checking" like this useful\', not \'Is it used?\'  I know it\'s not a commonly used concept, but it is a concept that people have been trying to introduce. Does the concept of "checking" to describe a subset of "testing" help with communication about tests and testing?  Would it be a good thing to introduce it to tester / QA vocabulary?\nI work on several projects were the client wants basically the same application implemented in both iOS and Android. At the end of the day, you have to test both - they are distinct pieces of software, just wondered if anyone has found any tips / tricks here. We\'ve started doing client acceptance testing with one platform, then using this as a baseline for the 2nd platform - this kinda though turns into a \'spot the difference\' competition.\nHere\'s the basic setup - over a number of years the testing team at my workplace has developed a sophisticated (probably rather more complex than strictly necessary) object-oriented, data-driven framework for our company\'s software product (a suite of intercommunicating applications that operate transactionally - that is, more than just data entry).\nAn unfortunate combination of events has left the team with a manager who knows little about the product, and me as the automation expert. One new hire with a lot of experience in relatively static data-entry automation and the manager are convinced that the automation framework is "too complex" and the reason it takes too long to get automation running.\nHow do I convince them that despite the complexity the framework is a robust, reliable tool and their preferred solution (glorified record and playback with a host of duplicated functions because of the transactional nature of the system) is a maintenance nightmare in the making? (I maintain the things. I know which ones are easier to debug and maintain.)\nAny advice here is welcome - my team is grossly overloaded with no sign of relief any time soon so I really want to avoid anything that could make things worse.\n\nI\'m a developer. Right now we don\'t have much in my firm in the way of testers. Whether I do it here, or go to a different firm, I\'m very interested in becoming a full time tester. \n\nHow would I prepare for a transition like this? I know I can read blogs and articles, but I\'m looking for something more substantial.\nWhat applications should I expect to be using (that I might be able to maybe even get a trial license to learn my way around?) Even if I\'m not using it at the position I go to, I may find valuable insight from using it.\n\nWhat sort of things should I study up on (that can be put on my resume, or otherwise dropped in a phone screen or interview? And yes, I plan to research and understand it, and use it in my personal projects, not just win a second round of interviews based on buzzwords.)\n\nThe term "Test Automation Framework" is become a cliche in automated testing.\nI have come across circumstances during work when my colleagues developed some reusable methods/function for an automation tool and propose it as if they have developed an automation framework. This is also often portrayed in Resumes.\nI personally find test automation framework a very wide term which might include (and not limited to) - language support, IDE support, Test Report Generation, Recovery Mechanism, Test Execution Scheduling, Test Report delivery mechanism etc etc. \nCreating some reusable methods in a language should/may not qualify as a framework, though it may add to over all framework. But then how do I let them know that their creation is not a framework?\nActually php undercontrol seems to consume a lot of memory so I\'m looking for replacement, in order to test a php application.\nWhen websites being deployed to the internet are about to go live, the age old question always comes up. "Which browsers should I test?"\nI am not asking that question because it will soon become obsolete. So, what I would like to know is what information or techniques are available to determine which browsers to test.\nIn the past I have used the wikipedia page of browser market share as the primary guide plus adding any soon to be realised browsers to the list, based on this criteria.\n\nIt is used by a significant portion of a sites users, and is in common, widespread usage.\nIt is the default browser on the latest version of Windows or Mac OS X.\nIt is a newly released, or about to be released browser which is expected to quickly gain a significant portion of browser market share, e.g. the current in beta version of IE.\n\nIs this the best technique available or is there something better?\nI am preparing an initial test plan document for a new project. The project involves several layers of HW and software and requires mainly black box testing but also some level of grey box testing (getting readings from within the code, but without actually reading or modifying the code).\nThe goal of this document is to assess the feasibility of the project from testing point of view- required test equipment, time, personnel, needed automation etc. \nThe approach I am going to use is to start by using a table with test types on one side (Functional, Performance, Stability) and modules/sub modules on the other side (GUI, computation engine, API from A to B etc.) then fill each square with high level headline for tests. When done, the table gives a pretty good idea of the project.\nI tried using MindMaps in the past, they were great for brain storming but quickly lost focus.\nAny other ideas ?\nRobot Framework claims to be:\n\na generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach.\n\nMy first impression is that there will be challenges in maintaining tests that combine natural-language text files with real code (as in Fit, Fitnesse) comparing to tests written purely in code. However, that\'s my only first impression.\nAre tests written in Robot Framework easy to maintain? Why yes? Why not?\nI\'m creating an API testing framework, and to avoid having a test class containing 1000\'s of lines of code I\'m looking at creating separate classes which will hold the xml data, which I\'ll then call in my test.\nMy initial thoughts were to create a payload class which would contain the XML elements for my test(an example is below)\npublic class CreateOrderPayload\n{\n    public static string OrderPayload()\n    {\n        XDocument OrderData = new XDocument();\n        XElement root = new XElement("Order");\n        DateTime now = DateTime.Now;\n\n        root.Add(new XElement("BillingAddress",\n            new XElement("AddressLine1", "Canada adress 17"),\n            new XElement("AddressLine2", "ccc"),\n        root.Add(new XElement("Customer",\n            new XElement("ContactNumber", "ContactNum"),\n            new XElement("EmailAddress", "andy@test.com"),\n        root.Add(new XElement("OriginalOrderId", "2315923148"));\n        root.Add(new XElement("Source", "fffff"));\n\n        OrderData.Add(root);\n\n        return OrderData.ToString();\n    }\n}\n\nIn my actual test I\'d then look to call the above class so that I can grab the payload to use for my test. I\'m using RestSharp to do this so would initialise my test with something like the below:\n        restClient = new RestClient(Constants.CRCOrderApi);\n        restRequest = new RestRequest(Method.POST);\n\nWhat I\'m trying to work out is how I would grab the XML from my CreateOrderPayload class to pass across into my test?\nWhen isolating a root cause of a failing test written in Python or Java, I use a debugger built in my IDE (e.g., Intellij) to debug it.\nIs the same possible for Robot tests? \nParticularly, what\'s a support for debugging Robot tests in IDEA Intellij?\nI wonder because I found Robot tests are a mix of both .robot and .py / .java fies.\nI\'m SM for an agile team.  One of our testers opened a couple of defects on a story (that really wasn\'t ready to be tested - but that\'s another issue). Before those defects were resolved, the tester continued to go through the remaining scripts and opened another defect.  Didn\'t go over very well.  Here\'s my question - Is it standard practice to piecemeal defects as you find them, or to test the entire story and THEN hand over the defects?  I would think all at once would be better, but I\'m not a programmer and I can\'t find any guidance online for this scenario. Thoughts?\nI tried using a regex for numbers only but it didn\'t work.\nBlow snapshot shows my configuration. i tried various combinations like contains, matches etc. \nI\'m responsible strictly for documenting and unit-testing a Golang project. In the part of the SUT I\'m currently on, a real file, identified by a file path, is being checked for its "Last modified by" time.\nIts code is thus: \n// AssetTimePath returns a timestamped path\n//\n// Parameters:\n//\n// - `s` :  the URL of the file\n//\n// Returns:\n//\n// - the timestamped path\n// - any errors\nfunc (view *View) AssetTimePath(s string) (string, *errors.ErrorSt) {\n    if strings.HasPrefix(s, "//") {\n        return s, nil\n    }\n\n    s = strings.TrimLeft(s, "/")\n    abs, err := filepath.Abs(s)\n\n    if err != nil {\n        return "", errors.File().AddDetails(err.Error())\n    }\n\n    time, err2 := utilities.FileTime(abs)\n    if err2 != nil {\n        return "", err2\n    }\n\n    return view.PrependBaseURI(s + "?" + time), nil\n}\n\nThe problem\nTo happy-path test this function, I would need to create a real file, maybe somehow track its absolute pathname, and delete the file afterwards. This seems inconsistent with unit-testing, as it is concerned with isolating all other factors to test individual units of work (such as the fact that there\'s even a string containing, but not ending with, ? iff the file exists).\nIs it ever acceptable, in a unit-test, to create a real file for testing?\nIf not, is this even fully testable?\nUPDATE : I overlooked the fact that I could just pass in the name of the very file the tests, or even this part of the SUT, is written in! \nThe spirit of this question still remains...\nI\'m using Selenium with Visual Studio 2017 on an ASP.NET MVC application. Driver is ChromeDriver 2.42.01. Everything works, however one of my tests involves clicking a div which is wrapped into an anchor:\n<a class="allowed" href="javascript:loadRegistrationPopUp(10031)">\n  <div class="selectContentContainer class-time">\n    ...\n  </div>\n</a>\n\nThe function is causing an error because it is undefined. \nLooking at the page source in Chrome, I find that a major part of the Javascript is missing, particularly the line that includes my script bundle where the function is living. If I open the very same page in a regular Chrome instance, I can see:\n<script src="/bundles/default?v=3n...pSQ1"></script>\nBut that script include (together with the Javascript) is missing when running with Selenium.\nTo make things even stranger: running the same test on another machine does work, the bundle is there. Same version of Chrome.\nWhat could be causing this?\nHow to identify this button in C#:\n <button class="reward_link_redeem_button_style" onclick="RedeemRPProduct(\'free_points_1\')">REDEEM</button>\n <button class="reward_link_redeem_button_style " onclick="RedeemRPProduct(\'free_points_50\')">REDEEM</button>\n\nBut there are like 4 buttons called equal, and to differentiate them you need the (\'free_points_1\') as well as (\'free_points_10\'), etc.\n\nI want to store issuedid in csv.\nis it possible?\nI\'m using Selenium IDE for Chrome and I\'m trying to click somewhere only if a specific element doesn\'t exist.\nIf I only wanted to do that, I can do it with an assert:\nassert element not present    css=.something\nclick                         css=.button\n\nHowever, this is part of a larger script and I want to continue with the rest of the script regardless of whether the element exists.\nSo I want to do something more like:\nif          {something which means roughly "assert element not present"}\n   click    css=.button\nend\n\nIs this possible? How do I do this?\nI need a solution how to iterate value of i. Actually my test case contain one webtable and table have five column also fifth column contain four buttons. So depending on the first column value(for ex "admin" which is in first row) validate the value and according to that same row fifth column first button i have to click on that. I am using page object model and my all locator place in java class(for ex AddRoleLocator class name) and my actual logic present in another java class(for ex. AddRole). So that how to iterate value of i.\nmy Locator key is like that\npublic static By noOfRows=By.Xpath("//table[@id=\'group-list\']/tbody/tr["+i+"]/td[1]");\n\nThis is my actual logic\nList<WebElement> noOfRows = wau.getData(KumoAccessManageLocator.KumoAccessManageTableRowCount);\n            int count = noOfRows.size();\n            System.out.println(count);\n            for(int i=1;i<=count;i++)\n            {\n                if(wau.getText(KumoAccessManageLocator.KumoAccessManageRoleName).equals(ConstantProperties.getProperty("kumo.accessMange.newRoleName")))\n                {\n                    wau.clickButton(KumoAccessManageLocator.KumoAccessManageviewRights);\n                }\n            }  \n\nso please suggest me how to resolve this problem with using page object model.\nI\'m getting the text as string and i need to compare it with a number, If its grater than that number then execute an if statement and if not then else.\nI\'m using following code :\nstring sato = driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(".user_reward_points")).Text;\nif (sato > 1200)\n{\n     driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#free_points_rewards > .effect2:nth-\n    child(2) .large-3:nth-child(3) > .reward_link_redeem_button_style")).Click();\n}\n\nThe Story\nWe have a mission critical AngularJS application which we extensively test with e2e tests using Protractor/WebdriverJS. At the current state, we have ~30000 lines of existing e2e tests which are executed daily multiple times either fully or partially for multiple different reasons (e.g. daily or smoke tests).\nThe application itself is in the beginning stages of "migrating" to ReactJS and the biggest question our QA department is facing is whether we can keep the existing set of e2e tests. As you probably inferred from the size of the test code, we\'ve been investing in e2e tests a lot.\nWe\'ve been following Page Object pattern and try to keep the page definitions separated from the logic of the tests.\nOne of the issues that will arise if we try to adopt Protractor test codebase to work against a React-based app is that Protractor would not be able to "sync" with Angular on every selenium command breaking the current natural flow of the e2e tests - I would imagine we would need to put explicit and implicit waits all over the codebase to make sure desired pre-conditions are met before any actions are applied.\nThe Question\nWhat are the pros and cons of adjusting the existing test codebase to work with a ReactJS based application vs starting with e2e tests from scratch with, probably, a better "React-friendly" test framework? What things we should consider to make this decision?\nI\'m using RESTassured with Java. Getting response in compressed from UTF16 format.

am developing a Selenium Test Automation Framework for the purpose of testing multiple websites. \nI have currently set up the Framework in Visual Studio using C# and implementing the Page Object Model. \nThe Framework itself is a C# project and the Test project is separate but references the Framework. \nI am happy with the fundamentals of the Framework but I want to implement some Data Driven aspects in order to increase the durability of the tests. I currently have NUnit running paramaterised test using [TestCase] but the data is hardcoded by me. \nThe ideal scenario would be to add a DatabaseHelper class to the Framework which would allow me to define queries on the database under test to return values and Nunit would repeat the same test for each row of the SQL query. \nHas anyone here implemented a similar method and how would you go about creating it? \nThere is a form having only two field name and Code. Code validation criteria is minimum 2 and max six character. As soon as you enter 2 character save button become enable.\nNow, problem is when selenium enter two character in code save button become enable and data got saved while automating. but in reality Selenium code has to pass six characters in Code. Instead of six it is only passing two.\nI am using Cucumber and POM, C# Selenium webdriver\nthanks in advance\nIt is said that increase in the appraisal costs (i.e. costs spent for finding non-corfomances - testing, reviews) decreases the failure costs (that comprise of internal (fixing of bugs we found + retesting ) and external failure costs (fixing bugs that customer found + retesting).\nWell, I think it is only true if the cost for defects found by customer is higher. What I mean is:\nwhen I invest in the testing, the cost of rework of defects it discovers will be more or less the same as if the customer discovered it. My developers are paid the same, no matter whether they fix a bug found by the customer or ourselves. Of course, there will be some overhead included and I do not take into account indirect costs like our reputation going down for producing buggy software.\nBut I just do not believe the failure costs decrease as appraisal costs increase, as several books state.\nTake the following situations:\nMore testing, less customer defects\nCost of testing: 10K (several issuses found)\nRework cost of internally found defects: 5K\nRework cost of externally found defects 3K\nTotal=18K.\nLess testing, more customer defects\nCost of testing: 2K (not many issues found)\nRework of issues (few ours + all from customer): 12K. (more twice as much as in the previous situation)\nTotal=14K\nWhat I saved on testing I spent on fixing and even saved a bit.\nI need to load test a chat tool with multiple rooms and channels which will test the overall load of thousands of users from multiple locations in all of the rooms, real time live chats in at least one room (hundreds of users) and simultaneous sidebar/1:1 chats.

But answers regarding other projects are also appreciated.\nThis is one of the most common needs today and consequently a common interview question.\nThis question is intended to be a canonical answer to the general question of "How do I test an API".  Other questions in this vein are more specific.  For this question I am going high-level as indicated by the short question title.\nI have a feature file with the following:\nScenario: Test something\n    Given I do something to test something\n\nMy step definition:\nimport io.cucumber.java.en.Given;\n...\n@Given("I do something to test something")\npublic void doSomething()\n{\n....\n}\n\nFrom my pom.xml:\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>\n        <artifactId>cucumber-testng</artifactId>\n        <version>4.6.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>\n        <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>\n        <version>4.6.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n\nWith the above, I can run my code using my runner, but in the IDE (IntelliJ IDEA) the step in the feature file is complaining about an "Undefined step reference". When I CTRL-left-click the step, it does not take me to the method for the step.\nIf I change my import to:\nimport cucumber.api.java.en.Given;\n\nEverything works as expected (i.e. the step is found), but then I get a warning about import cucumber.api.java.en.Given being deprecated (and the "Given" in my code has a line going through it).\n\nHow can I make my the feature file work so that when I CTRL-Left-Click on a step it will take me to the method for the step, but also avoid the "deprecated" warning?\nThis script is not working as the string contains single quotes (\') and double quotes (") and comparing the string is not working in this case. \n${Key1}=      set variable     It\\\'s in \\"Detailing\\": The Perfect Gift\n${KEY_FLAG}   run keyword if   "${Key1}"=="It\\\'s in \\"Detailing\\": The Perfect Gift"        set variable        X1\nlog     ${Key_FLAG}\n\nAny solution ?\nI\'m currently exploring FitNesse/Slim as an automated test tool. Scenarios are defined on a page named Example.ScenarioLibrary, and this particular test is defined on Example.T002Scripts.\nI\'ve defined a recurring scenario, which creates a task in the System Under Test, that I want to use in many different tests. However, the task names need to be different. I tried to arrange that by including ${RUNNING_PAGE_NAME} in the Slim table.\n!2 Task configuration\n|scenario        |create new task with duration           |duration                               |\n|click           |New                                                                             |\n|enter           |[TEST] ${RUNNING_PAGE_NAME} @{duration}s|as|Name                                |\n\nThis sort-of works, except that this produces the following Name: [TEST] <a href="Example.T002Scripts">T002Scripts</a> 20s. I want (and expected) it to be [TEST] T002Scripts 20s or [TEST] Example.T002Scripts 20s (both would be fine). Is there any way to get rid of that HTML markup?

Or should the charter only be defined before the explorative test? \nIs there a way to get scripts in Java when I record using Katalon studio ? \n\nLet me start with my background,\nBeen in the industry for over a year, got the wonderful opportunity to join the team despite no prior background, loving and enjoying every moment so far actually. My only dilemma is that there were no senior QAs to pass down their knowledge to me.\nOur teams are divided into frontend and backend, and I am part of the frontend team. As I mention, this is my first ever role, with no senior QAs passing down their knowledge. We have existing projects, but I felt like our automation weren\'t that great, in a sense that most of them are flaky, and I was fairly new to the role, so I didn\'t know much about automation strategy apart from the fact that - "Automation is good! You don\'t need to test things manually!"\nAfter a while, I realise there is some truth to that, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean automate everything, which was my thoughts previously, to try to automate as much functionality each sprint.\nNow we are starting a new project, and I am, again the sole QA for the frontend team. I would like to know how other teams approach their manual UI regression testing and also how you go about approaching automation\nManual: We all know that UI is very fragile, and there are lots of part and bits of pieces to it. From my experience, anything and literally ANYTHING could happen. So how do you guys keep track of every single thing?\nAutomation: From my learnings, it seems that UI automation are very flaky and should be kept to a minimum due to the always changing nature of the frontend. Since I am solely focusing on frontend, how would you guys decide on what to automate etc?\nAny input would be appreciated. Would love to hear how other companies approach their frontend testing\nThanks in advance\nI am capturing URl and path from s3URL from previous response. Some time S3URL not generated then URL and Path not found. In this case i want to hide error because it is application issue not scripting issue.\nTest object: a big monolith application (~500k loc) developed in Java for the last 15 years. Big and (probably overly) complicated backend + web frontend. There are many business processes implemented in the app. Currently there are 10 teams working on it.\nTests: there are unit tests and integration tests implemented. Code coverage is at around 70%.\nThere are also MANY automated system and e2e tests implemented in a commercial test tool.\nIssues: \n\nthere are way too many system and e2e tests. They were added over the years as at first there were no other tests being written. Only after a while someone thought of adding Java-based unit and integration tests.\nApart of the code coverage of the unit und integration tests the test coverage is a big unknown. The knowledge about which functionality is tested by what system test is kept only in the heads of the testers. There is no real way to know which tests need to be fixed, when a new story is implemented, other than running the regression test suite and to look what broke.\n\nQuestion: In my opinion we need to get rid of a big chunk of the system tests ASAP, as they are not maintainable any more, flaky and take waaay to long to run (~24h concurrently on 50 VMs). There are dead tests, that test removed functionality, many duplicates etc.\nIn order to do that first I would like to know the test coverage, to be able to tell which tests are useless and can be deleted safely.\nI am looking for a way to determine/estimate the test coverage in such a project \nThe obvious way of connecting the test with the corresponding user story/requirement will not work, as for quite many of the implemented functions there are no documented requirements.\nThe monolith is right now in the process of being refactored into roughly independent modules. The current idea is sorting the system tests based on their belonging to these modules. Additionally the tests belonging to one module can then be sorted based on the business process they test inside that module. With this I should have database of tests broken down by the modules and then by business processes, and thus a rough test coverage estimation by process and module. This still does not convince me, as being the best approach though.\nSo does this make sense? How else could the test coverage be determined/estimated?\nAnalyze the following highly simplified procedure:\nAsk: "What type of ticket do you require, single or return?"\nIF the customer wants "return"\n     Ask: "What rate, Standard or Cheap-day?"\n      IF the customer replies "Cheap-day"\n           Say: "That will be 11:20"\n       ELSE\n            Say: "That will be 19:50"\n       ENDIF\nELSE\nSay: "That will be 9:75"\nENDIF\n\nNow decide the minimum number of tests that are needed to ensure that all the questions have been asked, all combinations have occurred and all replies given.\nThe answer is 3. Please help with this: why the answer is 3? I do not know to justify.\nLately I keep seeing articles about how artificial intelligence will revolutionize how quality assurance is done (one simple example here. There are even online courses online for AI in Software Testing.\nIs AI in software testing a real thing - in terms of creating test cases, creating the appropriate tests and executing them?\nWe have a problem in our development team, the development throughput is much higher than our QA members can test.\nOur test team found itself in a situation where a new feature needs to be tested every two days.\nSo we have to do function, regression, exploration, and other testing, this loop takes a lot of time because any change or commit in the source code forces it to repeat everything.\nThey are now waiting for the developer to run his tests in the middle and before the end of the sprint. Is there some kind of best practice for such bottlenecks in the agile environment?\n\nSo one should rather solve the problem from the Project Owner side.\nPlan fewer tasks in sprint planning? \nShould tasks be rejected in order to avoid this bottleneck?\nShould sprint planning be further punished?\n\nI already described the problem in the retro, the solution was a shortened sprint planning. But, depending on the effort, we still have the problem that we run into this bottleneck over and over again.\nBut the problem is, we also write and review the test automation. But we simply can\'t keep up with passing the "normal" test, adapting the automatic test at the same time or creating a new one, everything together is simply no longer achievable.\n\nSo should the execution of the test automation also be included in\nthe sprint planning?\nBut wouldn\'t this even worsen the problem?\nWhere exactly are the priorities to be defined now? Write and adapt\nthe test automation, or just normal test, i.e. Explorative,\nFunctional.\nWhat is important Whitebox or Blackbox test?\n\nEspecially small teams with few testers and a lot of tasks have these problems in front of them. On the one hand we all know that in the agile world speed is everything, but it is forgotten that the QA is sometimes simply too much burdened. We are only human beings! \nEven if the project owner is looking for solutions and everything was reported in the retro, not everything can be solved. Depending on the size of the project, you always have a bottleneck somewhere, and yes it is somehow desperate!\nI am currently assigned to a new project, on a Scrum team that didn\'t have a tester integrated before.  There are no test cases yet, but the project is more advanced. \nSo I\'m busy defining test cases myself right now. I would like to have my test cases checked by the developers within the Scrum team. \nEven though it\'s always very time consuming, I have to be sure at the beginning that my test cases are correctly defined and that I\'m up to date. My test cases have to be up-to-date, right from the start. \nThe project owner sees it differently and thinks that the developers are just too close to their development to decide whether a test case is set up correctly. \nI see it differently, because wrong test cases are worse than time problems within a sprint. Wrong test cases that are not reviewed also blow up projects.\nProblems\n\nA review of all new test cases would take too long for me as the only\ntester in the Scrum team.\nA bad review can lead to bottlenecks.\nIf the test cases are not removed, I have to work constantly to adapt\nthem.\nIn my opinion the Project Owner does not see the problem that the\ntest depends on these test cases.\n\nWhat have the experts and career professionals learned in this field, what wise nuggets of information can be passed on and what has been learned from real experiences ?\nWhat advice from experienced professionals in the field can help me in driving change within organization and contribute to a testing mindset?\nHow can I be a leader in this space?\nFor example:\n@FindBy(xpath = "//div[@id=\'panel\']//span[@class=\'name\']")\nprivate WebElement panel;\n\nI\'ve got a panel element. Is it possible to get value of XPath that I init above?\nI need a solution how can I return:\n\n//div[@id=\'panel\']//span[@class=\'name\']\n\nstring in a test.\nI want to validate that field is not editable.\nCode I am trying is:\ndriver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@comp-id=\'1494\']")).click();\ndriver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@comp-id=\'1494\']")).sendKeys("PleaseCHECK");\n\nBut this is not working as it successfully pass this and according to my TC this is incorrect\ndiv of above element (which is not editable) looks like:\n<div tabindex="-1" role="gridcell" comp-id="1534" col-id="FGA_PROCESSOR" class="ag-cell ag-cell-not-inline-editing ag-cell-with-height ag-cell-value ag-cell-no-focus" style="width: 97px; left: 1864px; "></div>\n\ndiv of editable field looks like:\n<div tabindex="-1" role="gridcell" comp-id="1532" col-id="fgaConfigDescription" class="ag-cell ag-cell-with-height ag-cell-value ag-cell-focus ag-cell-inline-editing ag-column-hover" style="width: 175px; left: 1581px; "><input class="ag-cell-edit-input" type="text"></div> \n\nOnly difference between editable and non editable fields is on INPUT tag.\nI just need to make sure that the field is not editable and doesn\'t accept any text/data\nMany testers are aware that sometimes it is not easy to mediate between developers and testers or to find a common approach. \nSometimes, anger also tends to rule on both sides. Within ISTQB this area is also described and some right points are mentioned. \nFrom my experience, one should approach certain issues very carefully, build bridges and find common ground. To have an open ear for the problems, but also to recognize grievances in the processes early and to solve them. \nWhat has always been clear over the years, however, is that the test department is only seen as an appendix to the development. How often in 20 years QA has heard the sentences "Test, oh we\'ll do that later", "We don\'t need a test for that at all". But what has also improved through the Scrum process is that the individual test is defined as part of the team, at least in this process. But tensions are also unavoidable. \nI would be interested:\n\nHow do you avoid tensions in the processes?\nHow can the testers be better integrated into the processes?\nWhich psychological approach should be used if the tensions between testers and developers hinder existing processes? \n\nI\'m working with an automated script for multiple checkboxes that has dependent permissions.\nGiven there are multiple checkboxes\n\nCheckbox A \nCheckbox B \nCheckbox C \nCheckbox D \nCheckbox E\n\nWhen I select Checkbox A\nThen Checkbox C and Checkbox E is selected\nI\'ve handled this using a switch statement because there are multiple combinations but its kind of messy because certain checkbox(es) are not only selected but disabled as well due to the dependent permissions:\ne.g.\n    public boolean multipleCheckboxVerification(String roleName) {\n    switch (roleName) {\n        case CheckboxA:\n            return permissionPage.isSelectedChkA() && permissionPage.isSelectedChkC()\n                    && permissionPage.isSelectedChkE() && !permissionPage.isEnabledChkC() && !permissionPage.isEnabledChk();}\n\nMay I kindly know if there is a cleaner way to return which checkbox isn\'t as expected?\nI\'m currently just using assertTrue from TestNG but the output seems to be vague of which checkbox is actually failing.\nI was looking for an output where the error message would display "Checkbox E is enabled where it should be disabled"\nI have 2 questions:\n\nWhat is the difference between Selenium builder and Katalon? I think both are same  \nAre building scripts used in these tools good enough for passing an interview? I mean: If we can create scripts with these then why we are learning to code?\n\nI need to do penetration testing, I\'m scanning  the vulnerability of My Web Application using VEGA tool.

Next to the iframe is a long list of options (hundreds of options). Writing text in an option updates email text in the iframe. selecting a border color from the options changes the border color in the iframe, and on, and on.\nWe have a dozen email templates, and each one has several dozen to hundreds of options. Testing is critical because occasionally there are duplicate fields that do nothing and other bugs having to do with the kinds of emails we are building.\nEven using page objects this is incredibly long. In this situation do testers write a script for each option, or do they write a function that crawl all inputs, write some text in them depending on what the input is supposed to do (by checking label heading), and then switch to iFrame to find a change?\nI am using testNG with selenium to write my test cases, I observed a strange problem that is When I run my test cases, and if any test case fails or any other exception occur in between the test case execution, the AfterTest method doesn\'t run but the driver.quit() method is written only inside the AfterTest method, so in this case it doesn\'t actually quits the driver and it keeps running even after test case execution is finished.\nThe other problem is that during the execution my application opens the new windows of browser but when the execution is successfully completed only single window is closed on which I am working and the other browser windows remained open. Kindly advice some good approach t o handle this situation.\nBackground:JavaScript based automation frameworks heavily depends on  asynchronous execution, promises, callbacks, anonymous functions, etc which are inherently complex and probably an overkill for a straight forward task like UI test automation where we identify objects based on some locators and perform operations.\nProblem Statement: why should we choose JavaScript as a language for UI test automation considering it\'s fundamental asynchronous nature?\nWhat are the trade-offs of choosing it as a language for test automation?\nDisclaimer: I have designed a couple of large automation frameworks using the protractor for multiple applications, but I want to understand the trade-off of choosing JavaScript as a language for UI test automation?\nNote: I raised this question initially on Stack Overflow but as did not get much response so thought of this might be a better platform as focused on QA only.\nOther Similar Questions: Also I have seen other close question(as remarked by Peter),but I think that question is based on the premise where we already have large test base in python/other language but I am taking one more step back where we even don\'t have any tests in any language.Should we even then consider JavaScript as a language for UI test automation in first place considering its inherent complexity and quirkiness for straight forward task like UI automation???\nBit of a weird one but I need to test a specific page on a site - Does anyone know of a web site or tool somewhere that i can provide the exact url to and it hit the site say 200 times or something along those lines?\nMy company is currently using Bamboo and Jenkins for our build CI (depending on project) and we\'re moving into using TestRail for our test case management as Zephyr wasn\'t providing the necessary level of functionality.\nIs it possible to directly integrate Bamboo and Jenkins into TestRail so that our build tests, etc run and automatically update TestRail?\nI would like to ask this time your view on what aspects would you consider to tickle when a strategic component like memory is replaced (in embedded system).\nBasically, the main goal is to ensure that the software/firmware can run smoothly without any problems, but due to drivers changes, memory partitions, memory access time or even memory technology replacement can lead to large change in the software/firmware infrastructure, so in cases like these what approach would you choose to validate the software/firmware?\nI have checked Google for this error.

The project is comprised of these packages, \n\ntestdata - holds testdata.java. This returns random test data for my tests like passwords, names etc...\nutility - this package holds the object repository configuration class. This also contains the ExcelConfiguration class.\npageObjects - this package holds the page object class of the current system under test (e.g Login.class, Register.class etc...)\n\nAnd the other java project was the TestProject.

Then I got a call and they are looking more of a software engineering in test. Now this brought me to a question to myself and my fellow QAs:\n\nWhat is Software Engineer in Test?\nI am currently doing automation - selenium and C#. This may still mean I am not a software engineer? I may do coding but now I came to realize I am just automating the manual test cases. Are there other uses of automation aside from just automating the manual test cases or am I just not on the right track?\n\nHas anyone used RobotFramework to write automated browser tests and then used Blazemeters chrome plugin to record those tests and utilize Blazemeters performance test tools?  Is this even possible?\nI\'m looking for some advice on how to instantiate my WebDriver driver instance in my automation framework (Selenium 3.0.1 / Java 8 / TestNG).\nMy goal is to handle all the instantiation code in one place, in my framework code, separated from my tests themselves, and then pass that instance around the framework.\nIn Ruby, I would do something like this:\n./framework/driver.rb\ndef initialize\n  $driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\n\n  # additional driver configuration\nend\n\nThen I would include the framework classes in my base test class and call my driver from there.\n./tests/utilities/base_test.rb\n  def setup\n    Driver.new\n  end\n\nI would then have all my tests inherit from BaseTest.\nIn Java, I am unfamiliar with how to achieve this with access modifiers and package structure.\nSo far I have something like this (taken from Selenium HQ 1):\n  public class Driver {\n\n  private static ChromeDriverService service;\n  private WebDriver driver;\n\n  {@literal @BeforeClass}\n  public static void createAndStartService() {\n    service = new ChromeDriverService.Builder()\n        .usingDriverExecutable(new File("path/to/my/chromedriver.exe"))\n        .usingAnyFreePort()\n        .build();\n    service.start();\n  }\n\n  {@literal @AfterClass}\n  public static void createAndStopService() {\n    service.stop();\n  }\n\n  {@literal @Before}\n  public void createDriver() {\n    driver = new RemoteWebDriver(service.getUrl(),\n        DesiredCapabilities.chrome());\n  }\n\n  {@literal @After}\n  public void quitDriver() {\n    driver.quit();\n  }\n\n  public WebDriver getDriver() {\n   return driver;\n  }\n}\n\nMy question is, how can I pass this driver instance around my framework (for example, I want my Page objects to be able to use it).  In Ruby, I triggered the creation of a global variable from my BaseTest.  In Java, I\'ve added the getter to return the driver instance.  But this is problematic when I try to introduce TestNG annotations.  For example, I want to create/teardown a driver before/after every test.  I can get it to work, but is this best practice?  Is there a better way?\nFor example, instead of using TestNG annotations to instantiate my driver, would it be better to use listeners?  I\'ve also heard about Guice and dependency injection -- is this a useful design pattern?\nI\'ve seen a number of tutorials, blog posts, articles, etc., on this topic, but I can\'t find what I\'m after.  Again, my main goal here is to handle all my driver instantiation in one place in my framework in such a way that I can pass that same driver instance around.  It shouldn\'t matter whether it\'s a local ChromeDriver instance or a Remote WebDriver instance running on a grid.  I need it to be clean and scalable.\nI\'m getting an issue when try to automated user type on Redactor text editor.\nHere\'s the details:\n\nUsed command click or clickAt on Redactor text editor   \nUsed Locator with ID, Name, or Class.\nUsed command type and input the text\nUsed command click on Save button\n\nAll of the test case was PASSED, but no text typed/appear on Redactor text editor after click on Save button, why is that?\nI have created a script in virtual user generator, opened that script in controller and ran it.

For instance, how would you test a script such as this one:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nbuild="$1"\n\n# check that build number is passed\n[[ -z $build ]] && { echo "missing argument: build"; exit 1; }\n\ncd ./visual || exit 1\n\ncurl "https://" | grep -o \'https://[^"]*\' > artifacts.txt\n\nawk -v TOKEN="$TOKEN" \'/current/ {print $0 "?token=" TOKEN;}\' artifacts.txt \\\n| xargs -P4 -l1 wget \\\n  --content-disposition \\\n  --force-directories \\\n  --no-host-directories \\\n  --cut-dirs=5\n\n# let\'s remove our token from the filename\nshopt -s globstar\nfor file in **/*; do\n  mv $file ${file/\\?*/}\ndone\n\nrm artifacts.txt\n\nHow do I check I have been cd to the correct directory?\nCurrently I stub cd to check how it\'s call.\n  cd() { echo "cd $*"; exit; }  # mock\n  export -f cd\n  run my-script.bash "1234"\n\n  [[ "${lines[0]}" == "cd ./visual" ]]\n\nBut then the script continue to run everything after that.\nHow to test a pipe?\ncurl "https://" | grep -o \'https://[^"]*\' > artifacts.txt\n\nor\nawk -v TOKEN="$TOKEN" \'/current/ {print $0 "?token=" TOKEN;}\' artifacts.txt \\\n| xargs -P4 -l1 wget \\\n  --content-disposition \\\n  --force-directories \\\n  --no-host-directories \\\n  --cut-dirs=5\n\nWhat would you test and how? Is it possible to test part of the pipe?\nHow would you check value of an env var\nawk -v TOKEN="$TOKEN" \'/current/ {print $0 "?token=" TOKEN;}\' artifacts.txt \\\n\nHow would you chek that we use globstar?\nshopt -s globstar\nfor file in **/*; do\n  mv $file ${file/\\?*/}\ndone\n\nrelated: github issue\nI am new to TDD. we have already executed the test cases through karma-coverage.. If the test case count increases, the code coverage took more time to complete the job. so i had switched into concurrenlty to implement the parallel test case execution. Before that, the code coverage results are generated as single html file. But now, i had configure the coverage results into separate folders to improve the performance on test cases.  But now, the coverage results are generated as separate html  report. But i want to combine these separate folder\'s index.html file into single html report. \nso that, i have implemented the parallel execution of my repository using "concurrently". I had configured the gulp  generate the separate code coverage reports for each folder. Each folder has set of .spec file  The gulp configuration details is given below,\ngulp zero:\ncoverageReporter: {\n        dir: \'./cireports\',\n        subdir: "codecoverage/zero",\n        reporters: [\n            { type: \'html\', file: "UnitTestCover.html" },\n        ]\n    }\n\ngulp one:\ncoverageReporter: {\n        dir: \'./cireports\',\n        subdir: "codecoverage/one",\n        reporters: [\n            { type: \'html\', file: "UnitTestCover.html" },\n        ]\n    }\n\ngulp two:\ncoverageReporter: {\n        dir: \'./cireports\',\n        subdir: "codecoverage/two",\n        reporters: [\n            { type: \'html\', file: "UnitTestCover.html" },\n        ]\n    }\n\ngulp three:\ncoverageReporter: {\n        dir: \'./cireports\',\n        subdir: "codecoverage/three",\n        reporters: [\n            { type: \'html\', file: "UnitTestCover.html" },\n        ]\n    }\n\nIf I executed following command through command prompt, \nconcurrently \xe2\x80\x9cgulp zero\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgulp one\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgulp two\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgulp three\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nTest case was executed parallel and the coverage reports  generated in the specific folder. Each coverage folder has index.html file.  So I need to merge the coverage reports from all folders into single index.html file. \nI had tried to merge the coverage reports from following package,  https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat. So that I had installed the \xe2\x80\x9cgulp-concat\xe2\x80\x9d from following command, \nnpm install  --save -dev gulp-concat\n\nAfter that, I had configure the gulp.js to merge the coverage reports, The gulp-concat configuration is given below,\ngulp-concat:\ngulp.task(\'merge\', function () {\nreturn gulp.src([\'./cireports/codecoverage/zero/index.html\', \'./cireports/codecoverage/one/index.html\', \'./cireports/codecoverage/two/index.html\', \'./cireports/codecoverage/three/index.html\'])\n  .pipe(concat(\'index.html\'))\n  .pipe(gulp.dest(\'./dist/\'));\n});\n\nAfter test case execution completed, I had executed the \xe2\x80\x9cgulp merge\xe2\x80\x9d to merge the coverage reports. Expected output was not came. The merged index.html file was generated the series of coverage reports in a single index file\nCan anyone tell me whether there is any plan to implement the merging of coverage reports?\nRegards,\nThirunavukkarasu G\nI have a pretty small POM based project for learning Cucumber with Protractor.

A working reproducible repository is here.  \nDid anyone use MUNIT for API integration testing?\nI\'m exploring options to build automation suite for API\'s and among different options, there is not enough information regarding munit.\nCould someone point out the pros/cons of using munit?\nhttps://docs.mulesoft.com/munit/v/1.1/\nI\'m using Selenium and C# to test a widget that is implemented across multiple websites however on a few of these websites there is an additional drop down. I\'d rather not just ignore this additional drop down but I am trying to incorporate an if statement into my test to handle it. \n    [Then(@"I Input an Option If Available")]\n    public void ThenIInputAnOptionIfAvailable()\n    {\n        var option = CurrentBrowserFindElement(By.Name("option1"));\n    }\n\nI can\'t get past the point of finding the element - I am hoping someone here can teach me how to handle conditions similar to these with C# and Selenium. \nI have a scenario where I need to set up integration testing against our microservice architected application. This will mean creating some tests using Postman to hit our API, and running them with Newman.\nWe also use oAuth with Identity Server, so we need to initially authenticate, then receive a token back which is passed into all of the requests.\nThe problem is when we make the initial call to authenticate the user, how do we know that the user exists in the environment that we are running the tests?\n2 possible solutions that I can think of are:\n\nIn the test script, create the User at the beginning (and possibly delete them again at the end). This would be problematic for us because that part of the API is not public (we don\'t want external users to be able to create new users)\nDeploy a dummy identity service that will return an authenticated token. This doesn\'t feel like it would be a proper integration test for me.\n\nI was wondering how others would approach this sort of problem?\nI still do not fully understand the difference between a User Story and a Test Scenario. How are the two different?\nI was asked following question - \n\nThere is a form on a web page and it has UI validation, but UI\n  validation fails on QA environment and you log a bug for it. But\n  developer cannot reproduce it on his environment. What could be\n  possible reasons of developer not able to reproduce on his\n  environment?\n\nI had following answers -\n\nQA environment could have different build installed than what developer environment has.\nBrowser version could be different what QA and Dev checked up\nBrowser itself could be different what QA and Dev checked up\n\nCould you please suggest if above are correct and what could be other possible reasons?\nI sometimes see that issues that seem to be bugs, are declared as a feature or enhancement instead. Here is a contrived example.\nWe have an e-commerce website. Customers can add items to shopping cart, or remove all items from it. The issue is that customers can still place orders having zero items i.e. zero total cost.\nI feel that this is a bug, i.e. a logical bug. But, some people feel that this is an enhancement because we are changing how the ordering feature works. In this situation, I am convinced that it is a bug. \nBut, are there any situations where real bugs can or should be implemented as a feature/enhancement ? Does the difference matter ?\nI am new to TDD. I have configured the karma and gulp for my sources to generate the code coverage.

A tester writes a test case in a spreadsheet, with each test step and expected result. Then, another tester reviews the test case and approves it if its ok. The test writer then executes the test when needed.\nThe problem with the above approach is that sometimes, the test reviewers approve tests even when the test steps are missing some crucial information. This omission was discovered only when a third person was asked to execute some tests. \nSo, I was thinking of changing the process by making the reviewer execute the test. I believe that this might make the reviewer be more thorough because he has to execute the test, i.e. he cannot afford to miss important details. As an aside, the new way might bring out lack of documentation. When, reviewers find that system documentation is needed in order to run a test, then they will ask for it and mention it to our QA manager (during scrum meetings).\nDoes the new approach make sense ? If not, then are there any other approaches that we could try ?\nI am a newbie to Selenium. I am running a script which opens Static dropdown but it is providing error.

I have a test where I need to check if a spinner is not visible to the user. This is the first test of a series of tests, and until the spinner is not visible, the page elements are not displayed to the user.\nI have been trying to implement a wait in order to wait for the element to be invisible , but my tests seem to fail and the tests exit with a success code, however I can still see the spinner being available on the page.\nI have even tried the dirty browser.sleep() method, but my tests doesn\'t even wait for the sleep duration that I have given.\nI have this given block of HTML\n<div class ="loadingContent">\n<div class="always-loader">...</div>\n<div class ="first-time-loader">\n    <div>\n    <div class ="text> Preparing the App just for you</div>\n    <img src ="images/d92f6c4a.horizontal_loader.gif">\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nMy test checks that img is not present in the DOM or is not displayed.

I had the same code without Cucumber and my tests wait for the loader to disappear.\nCan someone point me in the direction where the issue might be ?\nWhat is the use of plus "+" symbol in code?\nEg: (char) (myRandom.nextInt(26) **+** \'A\')\nWe have a requirement for running multiple suites in parallel in our software testing services. \nBelow are the 3 approaches that I have tried so far:\n\nAdded parallel_tests in Gemfile.\nAdded \'require parallel_tests\' in rake file\xe2\x80\xa8\nCreated 02 nodes and also created a Grid Console for execution of both the nods in parallel\n\nResult: Only one node gets executed successfully instead of executing both of them in parallel.\nConfigurations used are:\nLanguage: Ruby 2.3\nMac: 10.2.3 version\nRpsec, rake file framework structure\nUser should not be able to close the browser using following methods. \n1)Clicking X button of browser window\n2)Using Alt+F4 \n3)Right-Click on Taskbar Icon + Close Window \n\n\nEdit : \n\nWe require this setup to run uninterrupted test on a machine that would be accessed by users and would have separate applications running at the same time of this test run. So we want to avoid our browser being messed around during that period. just want to run the tests in locked manner in a browser. User should be free to do anything else on that machine. \nWhen executing the test suite, Ranorex runs the Program class. However, when running Code Modules individually in isolation, they appear to be executed directly.\nI have code which I want to be executed in either case. But I cannot find a decent place to but it.\nOne option is to have Code Modules inherit from a base class which executes such code. Thereby, the base class code will be executed when a code module is run in isolation and also when it is run from within the test suite. However, this appears unintuitive, as I hijack the inheritance concept in order to solve an execution-order problem.\nI am Software Engineer in Test and I have been assigned to test the accessibility of a webpage. We already have manual QA\'s for this and I would like to ask the following.\n\nWhat do I do as a S.E.T. in this topic?\nAre there any frameworks that apply to this kind of testing?\n\nI have downloaded and imported Selenium 3.60 jars but unable to import packages:\npackage basics;\n\nimport org.openqa.selenium.By;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.Keys;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;\n\n\npublic class Synchronization {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver","N://drivers//geckodriver.exe");\n        WebDriver driver=new FirefoxDriver();\n        //driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5,TimeUnit.SECONDS); //implicit wait\n        driver.get("https://alaskatrips.poweredbygps.com/g/pt/hotels?MDPCID=ALASKA-US.TPS.BRAND.hotels.HOTEL");\n        driver.findElement(By.id("H-destination")).sendKeys("nyc");\n        driver.findElement(By.id("H-destination")).sendKeys(Keys.TAB); //tab operation\n        driver.findElement(By.id("H-fromDate")).sendKeys(Keys.ENTER); \n\n        WebDriverwait d=new Webriverwait(5,driver);\n\n        driver.findElement(By.xpath(".//a[contains(@href,\'North-Bergen-Hotels-Howard-Johnson\')]")).click();\n\n\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nI\'ve been using Selenium for awhile and I know many testers have compiled lists of standard security compliance types of tests to perform, like are listed here\nThese fall into a list of tests that are performed on every web site for basic security compliance, a short list here:\n\nForm Fields: Visible and Hidden  \n\n\nEscape codes  \nSQL Injections  \nNon-ascii, Unicode vs UTF-8  \n\nURLs  \n\n\nQuery String Manipulations\n\n\netc.\nQuestion: Since these tests are commonly repeated and fairly generic, has anyone compiled a list of Tests created with Selenium that target these well known security compliance related issues?\nSome granular extensions based on common security compliance checks like this:  \npublic static class WebDriverComplianceExtensions\n{\n    public static void InputOneSixty(this IWebDriver driver, By by)\n    {\n        var input = driver.WaitUntil(d => d.FindElement(by));\n        input.SendKeys("&#160;");\n    }\n}\n\nAnd hopefully some sort of intelligent extensions like:\nIWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\n// some page navigation...\nAssert.IsTrue(driver.PerformComplianceCheck(By.Id("FirstNameInputBox")));\n\nI\'m coming from a Java+Selenium environment, so maybe this is a mismatch of understanding that I\'m having with Javascript/Angular/Protractor.  I used to use IntelliJ\'s IDEA IDE for automation testing. I could actively do live search and on the fly testing of ideas using IDEA\'s Evaluate Expression functionality.  I could actively look for elements on a page (searching using CSS selectors for instance) and do a click (or see what the text is), and if my test was in debug mode it would do the click on the page. \nI was really hoping for a similar experience with WebStorm since it\'s IntelliJ\'s answer for Javascript development. I\'m in the middle of debugging a Protractor UI test and I can\'t look at the result of a getText() without doing a .then() clause and a console.log in the .then() clause.  I feel like if I do element.getText() in the Evaluate Expression tool I should be able to see what that Promise will evaluate to without having to do a then clause that resolves the Promise. I understand there\'s stuff having to do with the asynchronous nature of Javascript that requires the resolution of the Promise, but I would think this super smart IDE would have resolution stuff built in. Is there a way to setup WebStorm to say \'hey, resolve this for me and let me see what happens!"? I would hope for getting the same behavior when I evaluate element.click().\nWe need to consolidate Test cases across all projects.We have an idea of using Synchronizer.I am totally new to it. Currently we are using ALM 11.5 version.\nSo how to synchronize test cases from one projects to another.?\nI\'m looking for some studies, papers, statistics, ... about the (hopefully positive) impact of software testing in IT projects, especially the use of model based testing (MBT).\nI\'ve read about the chaos report published by the standish group but I\'m not sure whether its really sound?!\nI have some script which is written with selenium webdriver.\nActually, I have put some assert statement in between script.\nWhen an assert statement fails my script stops execution.\nIs there any way to continue my script after a failed assert statement.\nI am new to automation testing.\nI am testing my web application (php) using ranorex automation tool. Whenever I record my test case, it is recording perfectly but when I play my test case it stops(sometimes get hanged) at the middle and fail my test case.\nWhat is the reason that is creating this issue?

I have searched many times on  the internet. But, I couldn\'t find any of them to fulfill my requirements. For example, Pestt, this tool for control flow testing. Tool/software I\'m looking for is described as follow:\n\nIt\'s free or open source,\nIt has documentation and tutorial,\nDesktop or web-based application, and\nProgramming language for testing doesn\'t matter.\nI desire if the tool can generate data flow graph from given source code program, test requirements, test path, and coverage result in statistic.\n\nIf anyone know the tool/software, but it doesn\'t meet my description. Feel free to post a comment.\nSummary of data flow testing can be found here.\nEDIT: I used mouse events and did get a working solution that is pretty ugly :).\nSo I may be at a point that automating this page will not be possible. I am trying to click a popup menu that appears upon clicking an image (arrow). The problem is once I click the arrow, the popup menu does not exist anywhere that I can find. I cannot inspect its element either. It crashes the "inspect element" in IE (page must load in IE) and a using a third party extension DebugBar also does nothing.\nWhats happening is that in some cases when I select the popup link it opens in a new frame on the same page. The javascript changes everything for the new frame. When it instead uses a new URL (pop up window) I won\'t have problems navigating. Only when I need the new frame to appear so that I can get the new elments on the page.\n\nI am wondering if anyone have any ideas I could try. \nTo click the arrow I have to navigate the DOM using an Xpath as the id does not exist. (the "import" icon is a button separate from the arrow) Maybe there is something I can do with calling javascript in the source?\nI know the target in many places is the UCF_Mainframe. Just most of the changes happen in the javascript (which I can view all the functions by viewing source). What I believe is happening is the popup is all javascript rendered so its probably just an onclick event.\nThe main body:\n<TD id=import title="Import" class=clsHeaderItem selectedImg="x" unselectedImg="null" targetArgument="" target="UCF_X" url="" dataFrame="null" popUp="0">\n\n<TABLE style="TABLE-LAYOUT: fixed" cellSpacing=0 width="100%" cellpading="0">\n<TBODY>\n<TR>\n<TD class="BorderTop BorderBottom BorderLeft" height=55 width="100%" align=center>\n<DIV><SPAN id=0>Import</SPAN></DIV>\n<DIV align=center valign="middle">\n<DIV style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 2px; PADDING-TOP: 2px"><IMG id=0 src="x"><IMG id=0 src="xx">\n\n<IMG id=1 src="x3"> <---Arrow Element Here\n\n</DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD>\n\nThe problem I saw with creating a action builder was that it doesn\'t behave exactly like a mouse cursor so when you hover over the area it doesn\'t see it because there are no elements being hovered over it. Though I have not tried this extensively yet. Maybe I could try manually changing the mouse cursor location and than "click" but this is probably an ugly way to do things so I will wait to try it.\nIf all this fails I will have to end up going directly to the DB which I don\'t want to do. \nI have to test an application which does not have any specification or user manual. It has evolved over a period of time and there are no similar products in the market yet. I know exploratory testing is the way to go but where do I start? \nI have a set of automated checks running in a VM. The same cases are scheduled to executed against Chrome, Firefox and IE browsers. Internet explorer tests always fail with a black screen. Why? How can I solve this issue? \nI\'ve tried suggestion like leaving the VM logged on and so on but didn\'t help...\nI want to test an iPhone app on my Windows laptop.\nIs there any tool / simulator?\nHow can I install the build on that simulator?\nI am currently setting up PageObject with PageFactory Automation tests.

Please let me know if one is having a knowledge about this problem. My scripting language is javascript+Node.js and using selenium webdriver\nI am analyzing a web application and want to predict the maximum users that application can support. Now i have the below numbers out of my load test execution 1. Response Time 2. Throughput 3. CPU\nI have the application use case SLA Response Time - 4 Secs CPU - 65%\nWhen i execute load test of 10 concurrent users (without Think Time) for a particular use case the average response time reaches 3.5 Seconds and CPU touches 50%. Next I execute load test of 20 concurrent users and response time reaches 6 seconds and CPU 70% thus surpassing the SLA.\nThe application server configuration is 4 core 7 GB RAM.\nGoing by the data does this suggests that the web application can support only 10 user at a time? Is there any formula or procedure which can suggest what is the maximum users the application can support.\nTIA\nI had some questions around system/integration test. We have a development team and a full QA team, which does customer focused testing for our product. We want to introduce a middle test team which is more of an extension of the engineering orr, a system integration test team if you will.\nThinking about the rules for what the developers are expected to test, what this new team is expected to test, and the final QA customer team. The problem it is supposed to solve is the QA team gets code which is not really tested well, and falls apart right away, since developers are doing unit tests mostly, and QA is doing scale, customer focused scenarios. We are doing smoke to take care of the immediate fall apart, but want to do some more, take a bit of load off the devs, but not all the way.\nThe project is in python and its a bunch of different modules that interact with each other.\nDevelopers today do only unit tests, class level, and some very very limited "system" level tests. \nI was interested in finding out what other folks do for a mix like this. I want the developers to do more "System" level testing, something where they test their components end to end in the system perspective also, at some scale larger than one operation or two concurrent operations. But I am coming up against the question of what is expected out of this new team in that case. The only things I can think of are scale and a full all-components-together testing, but thats something the QA team will do in any case.\nI\'ve recently had some trouble getting automatic testing working on a new machine. I\'m using Codeception and Selenium, and everything worked fine on my old Windows 8 machine (I\'m now on Ubuntu). My coworker has also run the tests without problems on his Macbook. This is a Laravel project.\nWhen I try to run the tests (with ./vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance), a Firefox window opens, but does not resize to the specified window size, and never shows any content. After a minute or two, this is the terminal output:\nCodeception PHP Testing Framework v2.0.9\nPowered by PHPUnit 4.4.1 by Sebastian Bergmann.\n\n  [UnknownServerException]                       \n  Process timed out after waiting for 45000 ms.\n\nrun [-c|--config="..."] [--report] [--html[="..."]] [--xml[="..."]] [--tap[="..."]] [--json[="..."]] [--colors] [--no-colors] [--silent] [--steps] [-d|--debug] [--coverage[="..."]] [--coverage-html[="..."]] [--coverage-xml[="..."]] [--coverage-text[="..."]] [--no-exit] [-g|--group="..."] [-s|--skip="..."] [-sg|--skip-group="..."] [--env="..."] [-f|--fail-fast] [suite] [test]\n\nIf I close the window before the error is displayed, then another Firefox window opens, but it resizes correctly and begins running the tests. Huh? I can\'t even computer...\nWhy does this happen?\nEdit: Originally, when I closed the first window, I was getting another error, but upgrading to the latest Selenium (2.45.0) fixed that problem.\nIm not sure why, but ever time my screenshot is executed, the images are saved as blank.\nheres the code:\n    public void screenshotOnError() throws IOException {\n    WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();\n\n    long epoch = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    String ssTimestamp = String.valueOf(epoch);\n\n    File scrFile = ((TakesScreenshot) driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);\n    FileUtils.copyFile(scrFile, new File("/Users/sqadan/Desktop/workFiles/maven/MavenProject/screenshots/" + ssTimestamp + ".jpg"));\n    }\n}\n\nHere\'s the code that\'s calling this method:\n    @Test\n    public websiteProspector_beta doLogin(String myUsername, String myPassword) throws IOException {\n    logs.InfoDetails("Logging into Tomcat8- 2092");\n\n    try {\n        username.sendKeys(myUsername);\n        password.sendKeys(myPassword);\n        loginButton.click();\n\n\n        Assert.assertEquals(driver.getPageSource().contains(cF.homePage), true);\n        logs.InfoDetails("Login successful");\n    }catch (NoSuchElementException e) {\n        logs.errorDetails("Login unsuccessful");\n        tU.screenshotOnError();\n\nCan anybody help me out of getting tool tip from a  tag which is the object location where there is no title or any other attributes that contain the tool tip value.\nMy object location is present in the below tag:\n<rect style="cursor: pointer; stroke: rgb(192, 192, 192); stroke-opacity: 0.000001; fill-opacity: 0.000001; fill: rgb(192, 192, 192);" x="634.5" y="46.5" width="50" height="130" rx="1" ry="1" stroke="#c0c0c0" stroke-opacity="0.000001" stroke-width="1" fill-opacity="0.000001" fill="#c0c0c0">\nBut the tool tip value is "Standard, DLOB, 16,545,429"\nWe\'re using Jenkins to run tests against DB over TLS.

It looks like every time we upgrade JDK, keystore is refreshed. Is there a way to avoid reinstalling certificates every time we upgrade JDK?\nI am using selenium webdriver with python. I am not able to find a way in python by which I can switch the webdriver to a new browser.\nMy web application have  multiple links and buttons\nClicking on any of  them leads to a new browser window being opened.  \nfor clicking on buttons and link I have used below code \ndriver.find_element_by_css_selector("input[type=\\"submit\\"]").click()\ndriver.find_element_by_id("btn1").click()\ndriver.find_element_by_css_selector("#linksPlace > #OIT> a").click()\n\nFor selecting subsequent browser windows, I have used below code\nfor handle in driver.window_handles:\n    print handle\n    driver.switch_to_window(handle)\n    driver.get_window_position(handle)\n    driver.save_screenshot(\'E:\\Selenium scripts\\demo.png\')\n\nHowever  I am not able to navigate to that new browser window. I have used below command as well, but things didn\'t work\n     driver.switch_to_window(driver.window_handles[-1])\n\nIs there any way by which I can navigate to new browser window?\nI have seen that there are functions which exist in java and c# to do the same, but struggled so far in python.\nI\'ve seen the term "fixture" used in a number of different contexts, and I suspect I don\'t quite understand what is meant by the term, because I see it used to mean things that I didn\'t think it meant. At a high level, can someone provide a clear, concise definition of the term?\nI know the default answer to handling explorer.exe is to use AutoIT, but AutoIT utilizes Java Runtime to use the exported .exe to upload the file and close the dialog. My tests are all in Protractor since this is an AngularJS app.\nThe selectFile function is:\nselectFile: function(image) {\n  var path = require(\'path\');\n  var image_path = path.resolve(__dirname, image);\n\n  this.uploadButton.click();\n  this.uploadButton.sendKeys(image_path);\n}\n\nI\'ve run my full suite of tests in Chrome, Firefox, and IE11. Chrome and Firefox just leave the file upload window open and carry on their tests in the background. IE absolutely will not continue after clicking the upload button. The dialog box must be dealt with somehow, but my test can\'t even get to this.uploadButton.sendKeys(image_path); with that window open.\nIs there a way to kill that File Upload box via Javascript, whether it be by process id or something else?\n\nMore detailed info on my attempts at getting around this are on my Stack Overflow question from before I knew this site existed. Since you all are more specialized, perhaps I can get more / different answers here, too.\nI am helping my friend with some medical records verification. In short, I have to through hundreds of medical records and pinpoint certain ones for verification. I want to be able to search through these hundreds of records. The problems is that the medical records can only be viewed in a protected and private HTML document, which means I cannot extract them to a pdf. I believe that the documents are in from a asp.net database.\nMy best hope is to literally have my computer take a picture of the entire webpage. The computer screenshots, scrolls down, screenshots, scrolls down, screenshots .... etc. Does anyone know any program that will automate this iterative process. Once I have a pdf, I can easily parse it into searchable text. \nAny help is appreciated. \n'
